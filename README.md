*Note: OpenDominion is still in early development. Many features of the game have not been implemented yet.*

## Introduction

OpenDominion is an online text-based strategy game based on [Dominion](http://dominion.lykanthropos.com/www.kamikazegames.com/dominion/index.htm), a defunct online text-based strategy game from Kamikaze Games which ran from about 2000 to 2012 until [stopping indefinitely](http://dominion.lykanthropos.com/www.kamikazegames.com/dominion/GameOver.htm).

The goal of OpenDominion is to be an open source clone of Dominion, so that players can keep playing the game and developers can contribute and collaborate to develop and improve the game.
