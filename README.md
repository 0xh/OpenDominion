# OpenDominion Resources

This branch serves to hold resources to help develop OpenDominion.

## Dominion

A mirror of the original Dominion website I scaped off the web archive.

## Blackreign's OOP simulator

This spreadsheet contains a load of macros and won't properly work on LibreOffice and possibly versions of Excel newer than 2003.

I recommend opening this on Excel 2003 on a Windows XP virtual machine.

## Wiki

A mirror of the unofficial Dominion wiki I scraped off the web archive.

On Windows I had to edit the Wayback Machine Downloader source code to change ':' to 'x3a' so URLs with a ':' in the
filename could be saved on a Windows filesystem at `$pathToRuby\gems\2.3.0\gems\wayback_machine_downloader-1.1.4\lib\wayback_machine_downloader.rb`.

Sadly, I lost these changes and specific implementation.
