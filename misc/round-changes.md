# Rounds 74 - 71

# Round 70

Based on board feedback, here's what I intend to do for Round 70: 

* We'll be using the Base Ruleset, last used in Round 68. 

* The same pack randoming restrictions will be in place in Round 70 that were in place for Round 69. 

* Going to try to not lock out players from registering the first 12 hours of the game but I don't know if the underlying system can support delayed appearance in the game. I've seen this suggested several times but I don't think it is going to be possible. I'll look into it, though. 

* We'll give the suggestion of starting with a hero of each type a go, and remove hero gain. Heroes won't die, and will level up at increasingly more difficult rates as they gain levels. 

* Shrine will no longer increase the chance of level gain. 

* Shrine will reduce casualties by 4x to 80%, from 6x to 80%. 

* Shrine will increase the chance of hero level gain by 2x to 40%. If, for example, you had the maximum bonus and your chance of hero level gain was 10%, this does not increase your chance of gain to 50%, but to 14%. 

* Nomad and Spirit will be removed 

* Premium accounts will be able to change waves without re-randomizing their race.

-Ross


# Round 69

Below are the planned changes for Round 69: 

* We'll be using the Tech ruleset last used in Round 65. 

* The hero system in place for Round 68 will be carried into Round 69. 

* Packs will remain at 12 from 15. 

* The Energy Mirror change that showed items in your news will carry into Round 69. 

* Packs of size 4 or larger will now have randomized races. Players will be required to associate lifetime accounts during the registration process if they create or join a pack of size 4 or greater and will be unable to do so once registered. Players that do not join a pack or join a pack of size 3 or fewer will continue to be able to associate accounts as per normal. 

* For those that are part of packs of size 4 or greater: Users who purchase a premium account may restart one time to get a re-randomized race. This enables you to randomly be assigned Nox. Technically you can restart as many times as you want but your race will only be re-randomized one time, and only the first time after your premium access is applied. 

* The odds of a hero losing a level on a successful invasion will be reduced, but the odds of no level change will be increased by that amount.

-Ross


# Round 68

Below is the list of changes I anticipate making for round 68: 

* We'll be using the Base ruleset last used in Round 66. 

* Attacks will now be considered razes if they fail by at least 15%, down from the current 20% 

* Shrines will go back to 6x from 6.5x for offensive casualties 

* Shrines will lose the hero death reduction bonus 

* Dwarf Clerics will now be 4/4 from 3/4*, no price change 

* Your news will now show you when you reflect a spell from Energy Mirror 

* Realm size to 12 from 15 

* Heroes no longer die. Instead of dying heroes may lose levels (up to 2 on a failed attack, possibly 1 on a successful attack). The odds of leveling up will be slightly lowered from present (currently heroes always leveled up if they did not die), and sometimes a hero's level will be unchanged. 

I'm not sure what I intend to do next round yet per the current packing rules, but let this announcement serve as an early warning that packs will probably be changed somewhat. There has been discussion in reducing pack size to 4, or allowing packs of 6 to remain but requiring random race selection. I may go with one of these ideas.

-Ross


# Round 67

As previously mentioned, round 67 will be the Improvements ruleset. As per suggestions on the messageboards, here's a list of the other changes: 

* 4:3 attack restriction will be changed to 5:4 

* Exploration cost increase of 10% 

* Exploration cost bump at 5000 acres removed 

* Prestige multiple increased to 2.5 from 2 

* Peace is removed 

* Attacks will now be considered razes if they fail by at least 15%, down from the current 20% 

* Shrines will reduce casualties on offense by 6.5x, up from 4x, same maximum 

* Shrines will increase chance of hero gain by 6.5x, up from 4x, same maximum 

* No blackops until the 7th day of the round, except theft 

* Irrigation will be changed over to Harbor, per other rulesets 

* Tower bonuses will gain additional bonus per other rulesets 

* Dwarf Cleric will be 3/4 against all alignments, -30p 

* Gnomish Mining Machine down from +40% ore production to +30% 

* Dark Elf Adept +1/+1 per 8% Wizard Guilds from 10% 

* Lycanthrope Werewolf to 4/4, no price change 

* Nox military units will now have no ore cost 

* Nox Lich gains Flight 

* Human/Nomad Knight/Blademaster +25p 

* Firewalker Salamander +30p 

* Kobold Grunt +15p 

* Kobold Overlord +15p

-Ross

* Dwarf Cleric will be 825p (-55p) 

* Nox Lich will be 4.5 offense against both alignments with -75% casualties against both alignments 

* Nox Nightshade +70p 

-Ross


# Round 66

As previously mentioned, we will be using the Base Ruleset for Round 66. Below are the changes being made to this ruleset for the coming round: 

* Updated the message you get when you register for the round as per Rush's suggestion a few months ago. This is mostly just for new players to the game. 

* Decreased Goblin gem production bonus from 15% to 10% 

* Shrines will now reduce casualties on offense by 6.5x * shrine %, up from 6x (same max). 

* Shrines will now increase chance of hero gain by 5x * shrine %, up from 4x (same max). 

* Walls and Forges bonuses will be somewhat easier to attain, but still remain the two most difficult bonuses to increase amongst castle improvements. 

* All black ops, with the exception of theft, will not be able to be performed until the 7th day of the round. Theft remains unchanged, so it remains allowed at day 5.

-Ross


# Round 65

Next round will be the Tech Ruleset. I plan to carry over the changes to the Base set from last round: 

* 4:3 attacking restriction to 5:4 

* Exploration cost increase of 10% 

* Remove exploration cost bump at 5000 acres 

* Increase prestige multiple to 2.5 from 2 

* Remove Peace 

* Mixed aligned realms 

In addition to these changes from last round: 

* Attacks will now be considered razes if they fail by at least 15%, down from the current 20%.

-Ross

* Goblin max population -2.5% to +17.5%

# Rounds 64 - 63

Missing info


# Round 62

Still working on the rewrite. My schedule is not much changed from the last time I posted changes for Round 61. I'll continue to work on it when I have time, and I'll keep giving sporadic, small updates in the rewrite information thread. 

In the meantime, for Round 62, we'll be using the Base Ruleset last used in Round 60. You can view those rules here: 
http://www.kamikazegames.com/dominion/OldScribes/Round60/Scribes.htm 

Here is the list of anticipated changes for Round 62: 

* It's been requested that information gathering spy and wizard operations cause lower casualties on failed operations. These spy operations already result in half casualties as compared to other operations, and the magic operations result in zero casualties. I'm going to further reduce spy casualties to one quarter normal casualties from one half. 

* Further, information gathering operations will all be made slightly easier to succeed on. 

* Masonries will protect castle investments at .75 * percentage owned, up from .5 * percentage owned. The maximum bonus of 25% reduction will remain the same. 

* Icekin Frostmage: +25p, +20r 

* Icekin Ice Elemental: +50p 

* Kobold Underling: +10p, +5r 

* Human/Nomad Cavalry/Valkyrie: +50p 

* Wood Elf Max Population from -7.5% to -5%

-Ross


# Round 61

Missing info


# Round 60

As previously mentioned, Round 60 will be using the Base Ruleset from Round 58. There is only a tweak to the Goblins for the rules from Round 58: 

* Hobgoblin +50p to 1000p 
* Wolf Rider +25p to 1300p

-Ross


# Round 59

As previously mentioned, I wanted to get the new round up ASAP with the holidays coming up. Normally we would be in line to use the tech ruleset this round. However, too many changes to that ruleset might push registration into the middle of the week so I opted to go with last round's ruleset in its stead (the Improvements ruleset). 

As such, registration is already open, and we'll be using the ruleset from Round 57. The Scribes have already been updated to reflect this.

-Ross


# Rounds 58 - 53

Missing info


# Round 52

For Round 52 Classic will be using the Base Ruleset, last used in Round 50: 
http://www.kamikazegames.com/dominion/OldScribes/Round50/Scribes.htm 

There will be a few minor modifications to these rules: 

* Lycanthrope defensive strength will be increased from +5% to +7.5% 

* Firewalker Salamander will be reduced in price by 25p 

* Gnome attack strength will be increased to +7.5% from +5% 

* Dark Elf Spirit Warrior will be reduced in price by 50p 

* All wonders will be released by day 40 

* Masonries will increase castle improvements by a factor of 2.75x, up from 2.65x.

-Ross


# Round 51

Below are my planned changes for Round 51 based on the feedback given on the messageboards. Keep in mind that next round is the Tech Ruleset (last used in Round 47). 

* Realm size will stay at 15. 

* Shrines will increase prestige by a 2.5x factor up from 1.5x. 

* Masonrys will increase improvements by 3x, up from 2.5x. 

* Dark Elf Adept will increase in offensive and defensive power for every 8% Wizard Guilds, down from 10% 

* Dark Elf Spirit Warrior will increase in power from the Magical Weaponry tech, instead of the Dark Artistry tech 

* Dwarf Cleric -50p 

* Dwarf Warrior will no longer have a casualty penalty when attacking evil dominions, or receive that penalty when being attacked by evil dominions 

* Gnome Rockapult -30r 

* Gnome Juggernaut -50r 

* Nox Lich will gain in power from the Tactical Battle tech, not Dark Artistry 

* Undead Vampires will gain in power from the Magical Weaponry tech, not Dark Artistry 

* Undead Vampires will gain in power for every 12.5% Wizard Guilds, down from 15% Wizard Guilds 

* I remain undecided as to what to do with Lycanthropes. I will probably just reduce the price of the Garou. The alternative is to change conversions to the Garou from the Werewolves and reduce it's offensive power, as things used to be. That seems a less likely course of action.

-Ross

* Dwarf Warrior will no longer have a casualty penalty when attacking good dominions, or receive that penalty when being attacked by good dominions (instead of evil as previously announced) 

* Dark Elf Adept +75p 

* Lycanthrope Garou -100p

-Ross


# Round 50

Wow, round 50. 50 official rounds (and two betas). It's been a long time...this game has been running now for over 8 years. Some of you have been here for a long, long time. Thanks for playing. 

As I mentioned in the previous thread, not a ton of changes for the upcoming round. Most of these are just continuations of the Round 49 changes. I'm spending most of my time now trying to get a new game ready for beta sometime during mid to late August if possible, and then it's back to Dominion for an overhaul here. 

In the meantime, round 50 will be using the base ruleset. For those who would like to know the difference between the rulesets, I recommend looking at the wiki page at the (fantastic) Dominion Encyclopedia: http://www.lykanthropos.com/Dominion/wiki/index.php/Rulesets 

The "new" (mostly stolen from round 49) changes to round 50 base are: 

* Shrines will also reduce the chance of hero death by 4 * (Shrines / Total Land) % to a maximum of 50% 

* Shrines will also increase the chance of hero gain by 2 * (Shrines / Total Land) % 

* Right now after a successful invasion, the invaded Dominion begins suffering reduced casualties on successive hits. I've increased that reduction by 60%, thus further reducing casualties on the next hit. 

* Temples will now reduce defensive bonuses by 1.5 * %, down from 1.75 * %. 

* There will now be a maximum temple reduction of 25%. 

* Heroes will show class and level on the invade page. 

* Temple of Equality to 3% temples from 5% 

-Ross

Taking some of Dreki's suggestions: 

* Spirit/Undead Spectre/Vampire to 1000p from 1050p 

* Troll Smasher regains +1 offense vs Kobold and Goblin 

* Goblin/Dwarf Shamans/Clerics cannot kill Spirit/Undead units 

I'm also going to increase realm size to 15 from 10. I hope to have registration up tomorrow.

-Ross


# Round 49

We'll be using the Improvements ruleset for round 49. Not a ton of changes, but I've taken a number of suggestions from the boards. 

* Shrines will also reduce the chance of hero death by 4 * (Shrines / Total Land) % 

* Shrines will also increase the chance of hero gain by 2 * (Shrines / Total Land) % 

* Right now after a successful invasion, the invaded Dominion begins suffering reduced casualties on successive hits. I've increased that reduction by 60%, thus further reducing casualties on the next hit. 

* Temples will now reduce defensive bonuses by 1.25 * %, down from 1.5 * %. 

* There will now be a maximum temple reduction of 25%. 

* Realm size will be reduced to 10 from 20 since people seem to want to try it. 

* Heroes will show class and level on the invade page. 

* Improvements ruleset will keep the higher tech points on invasion, including scaling, that is currently present in the tech and base rulesets. 

* Wizard information gathering operations will cost 2% strength instead of 3%. 

* Lycanthrope Garou +120p to 1300p 

* Spirit/Undead maximum population to +15% from +10% 

-Ross

* Shrines will also reduce the chance of hero death by 4 * (Shrines / Total Land) % to a maximum of 50% 

I previously did not mention the maximum.

-Ross


# Round 48

Below are the changes I'm planning for Round 48 of Classic based on the feedback I have received. Nothing is really set in stone until registration opens, so check back as usual for any modifications to these changes. 

* Icekin lose the exploration cost penalty. 

* Wizard information gathering operations will cost 2% strength instead of 3% 

* Nox Lich will act as it currently does against Good against all races. In other words, Lich is 5/2 against all races, with -50% casualties, at the same price. 

* Nox Nightshade +125p 

* Great Flood will reduce boat production by 25%, down from 50%. 

* Human/Nomad Cavalry/Valkyrie -50p 

* Base ruleset will keep the higher tech points on invasion, including scaling, as per the tech round 

* Firewalker Gem Production to +15% from +10% 

* Firewalker gain new bonus: Construction Platinum Cost -10% 

* Masonry bonus increase to 2.65 from 2.5 * masonry % 

* Spirit/Undead to +15% max population from +12.5% 

* Troll Smasher lose extra bonus on Gobbo/Kobbo/Wood Elf 

* Kobold Grunt +25p 

* Goblin Wolf Rider +50p 

* Orc lose +5% defense bonus

-Ross

* Nox will also be losing their maximum population bonus to help balance the Lich change. 

I plan to have the scribes up late tomorrow evening along with registration for round 48.

-Ross

* Wood Elf Mystic +50p

-Ross


# Round 47

As mentioned previously, Round 47 will be the tech ruleset. Preliminary changes to this ruleset are below, taken heavily from suggestions: 

* Tech points gained on invasion will be the maximum of 10 or (days into round / 3). Thus, once past day 30, each acre gained by invasion will start giving more than 10 points. 

* Ancient Library / Halls of Knowledge will also contibute a +10% research point gain 

* Wood Elf Druid will gain 2 defensive power (from 0) 

* Wood Elf Druid +50p 

* Shaman and Cleric will lose the ability to kill Undead units. 

* Prestige will give a 2x bonus, up from 1.5x. 

* Sylvan Centaur will have 25% less losses, from 50%. 

* Land gain on invasion will be begin reducing more under 70%, instead of the present 75%. 

* Undead population bonus to +12.5%, from +10% 

* Nightshade to increase for every 10% constructed swamp buildings from 12.5% 

* Undead Vampire Dark Artistry to gain +1 attack strength from every 15% Wizard Guilds, from 20%. 

* Undead Vampire loses magical weaponry tech bonus 

* Lycanthrope Ratman -25p 

* Lycanthrope Garou -50p, -10r

-Ross

Several players made the case that with the new change, Nox was going to be overpowered. As a result, Nox will retain the changes previously mentioned but will lose the existing 5% population bonus.

-Ross


# Round 46

For the next round we will be using the base ruleset (the one from Round 44). This ruleset does not need many changes, but the changes being made are: 

* Prestige multiplier will be increased to 2x from 1.5x, for every 250 prestige. 

* Hero Deaths at low levels (6 and below) will be slightly reduced. 

* Icekin Ice Elemental -50p 

* Icekin exploring platinum cost +10% 

* Nox Nightshade +50p 

* Nox Lich -50p 

* Orc Savage +50p 

* Sylvan Centaur -15% casualties 

* Spirit / Undead +2.5% population (a total of 12.5%) 

* Halfling Staff Master -40% casualties from -15% 

-Ross


# Round 45

The following changes will be applied to the ruleset from Round 41 (Improvements Ruleset). These are not major changes, as per the usual now. I am working on some cool stuff for the future, but it's a ton of work and just not anywhere close to ready. It involves rebuilding the game in it's entirety in an updated programming language, so it's quite a large project. 

The changes: 

* Tech cost will be reduced by about 6%. 

* You will not be able to register using Hotmail anymore. Hotmail has problems receiving mails from KamikazeGames.com. I do not know why. I suggest GMail or Yahoo Mail. 

* Shamans and Clerics will lose the ability to kill Spirit and Undead units. 

* Dwarf Clerics will have 5 defense against evil and Spirits (instead of just Evil). 

* Gnome Juggernaut: +25p 

* Gnome Rockapult: +25p 

* Nox Nightshade: +100p 

* Human Cavalry / Nomad Valkyrie: -30p 

* Wood Elf Mystic +70p 

* Firewalker: +2.5% max population 

* Sylvan Dryad: -55p 

* Dwarf Warrior: -25p

-Ross


# Round 44

As mentioned previously there are only minor changes to the base ruleset for Round 44: 

* Tech costs are being lowered by 10%, along with the minimum cost for a tech. 

* The previous round's hero modifications are still in effect: Double bonuses for healer, miner, spy and wizard. Shrines will reduce the chance of hero death. If you have no heros you will have a 50% shot at getting one. 

* Human/Nomad Knight/Blademaster -25r 

* Halfling Defender Ore Cost reduced to 0 from 10. 

* Firewalker lose the food consumption penalty 

* Wood Elf Druid -45p 

-Ross


# Round 43

I've taken most of these directly from Fingal via his suggestions on the messageboard. The best way for you all to influence future changes is always to post. 

* We will be using the teching ruleset from Round 39. 

* Exploration cost increase will begin at 5k, with the cost increase slightly lower. 

* Masonry multiplier increased to 2.5x from 2.25x 

* Factory cost reduction to 3x multiplier from 4x. 

* Heroes added to tech ruleset. 

* Bonuses from Healer, Miner, Wizard and Spy doubled. 

* When a player has no hero, odds of getting a hero double. 

* Shrines decrease chance of hero death by shrine %. 

* Ruby Monolith decreases casualties by 30% from 20% 

* Factory of Legends decreases costs by 25% from 15% 

* Kobolds will be shifted to Good alignment from Evil 

* Human Cavalry +75p, +20r 

* Dwarf Warrior -100p 

* Dwarf Cleric -100p 

* Wood Elf Druid will increase power by every 20% forest from 25% 

* Halfling Staff Master +100p 

* Sylvan Dryad +100p 

* Sylvan Centaur -50p, gains -50% casualties bonus in addition to existing ability 

* Dark Elf Spirit Warrior -100p 

* Dark Elf Max Population +2.5% 

* Undead Vampire -50p 

* Lycanthrope Werewolf -100p 

* Lycanthrope Max Population +10% from +7.5% 

-Ross

Correction: 

* Factory build cost reduction to 4x multiplier from 3x. 

-Ross


# Round 42

Missing info. Additional changes:

I listened to the factory debate and decided to scale factories back to 4x build and 3x rezone, similar to how things were back in round 38 before they were increased in round 40.

-Ross


# Round 41

Below are preliminary changes for Round 41. This will be a 3rd ruleset, with most of the ideas here taken from the playerbase. Most of the mods are reduced to give the castle improvements more strength. Costs have been adjusted to slow OP growth down. In general there should be fewer mods to deal with early, and a slower growth of offense, which should keep the round more competitive. There is also a significant change for invasion's land gain which makes getting hit not hurt quite as much, and keep these players competitive. There is very little in the way of race balance for the new rules, but this should work itself out through changes in coming rounds. A few small adjustments might still be necessary in the more immediate term. Please note that these changes are based on the current ruleset. Any change mentioned below is a change to the round 40 ruleset that will become the 3rd primary ruleset that Dominion will use (in addition to the teching ruleset and the current base ruleset). The preliminary changes, in no particular order: 

* Lightning bolt is 75% as effective 

* Failed attack casualties are reduced by 25% 

* Prestige bonuses have been increased to 2% 

* Casualties on successive successful attacks reduced from 15% per to 25% per (max 80%) 

* Land lost from invasion has been reduced by 25%, and generated land increased from 15% to 50%. While the numbers do not sum to 0 (-25 + 35) the net result still yields roughly the same land gains as before, so don't read anything into that. The only difference is the source of the land. It will now hurt less to be invaded, but the invader still gets the same amount of land. 

* Improvement maximums are 20 science, 30 keep, 20 walls/forges, 60 towers/irrigation 

* Smithies reduced to 2 * % to a max of 30% 

* Same-race pack restriction, previously at most 2 in a group of 4 or larger, has been increased to 3. 

* Temple OP reducing bonus reduced to 1.5 * % 

* Guard Tower and Gryphon Nest reduced to 1.5 * % to 30% max 

* Temple of the Blessed, Temple of the Damned and the Great Wall have their 10% bonuses reduced to 5%. 

* Lumberyard production increased to 60 from 50. 

* Factories construction and rezone bonus reduced to 3 * % to a maximum of 60% 

* The "harder to reach" forges and walls formula has changed back to the same as the other castle improvements, making these easier to achieve 

* Wizard Guilds gain the ability to reduce wizard blackop damage from Fireball, Lightning Bolt and Disband Spies by 4 * % to 80% max 

* Starting buildings have been modified to reduce starting homes by 5, reduce lumberyards by 5, and increase starting alchemies by 20. 

* Approximately half of the wonders will begin the round in realm 0 with the standard 250,000 power. The others will continue to appear randomly throughout the round. 

* This ruleset will mix the good and evil alignments together. You can pack good and evil together, and realms will be mixed. 

* Ancient Library and Halls of Knowledge increase investment by 10% down from 20% 

* All gem bonuses removed from Gnome, Firewalker, Goblin and Dark Elf. 

* Goblin castle investment bonus removed 

* Dark Elf Spirit Warrior loses 95%+ 6.5 power. On attacks 75% of your size and higher, Spirit Warrior will top out at 6 power. 

* In what may potentially be the most unpopular change, all elite units (units 3 and 4 for each race) were increased in platinum cost by roughly 10%. 

The primary motivation with the above change is to slightly slow the growth of offensive power. Coupled with the smithy change that reduces their effectiveness, this should mean that there may be a period that people find using initial base units (units 1 and 2) to be a better strategy. These changes are intended to make that the case. Rapidly growing offensive power leads to stagnation and the buildup of excessive defense, further contributing to the stagnation. I'm hoping these changes help to mitigate this problem. Combine these changes with the lessened penalty for getting hit, and I think it could be quite interesting. 

As always, I expect to hear feedback on these changes. There is still time for me to make further changes if necessary. Nothing here is final until the round begins.

-Ross

Failed attack casualties reduction is for the DEFENDER, not the attacker.

-Ross

Starting homes are reduced by 15, not 5. Combined with the subtraction of 5 lumberyards, this balances increasing alchemies by 20.

-Ross

* The price increase for the elite Spirit/Undead units and the Garou are roughly 5% rather than 10%. 

* Factories will only be reduced to 4 * % to 60% max 

* Temple of Equality will have the effect of 3% temples instead of 5% 

* Masonries will increase bonuses by 2.75 * %, up from 2.5. 

* Orc lumber bonus reduced to 20% from 50% 

* All 4/0 spec units are now 375p (these are cost increases of 25 or 50p). 

* Merfolk Mermen and Dwarf Soldier both increased 25p to 300p. 

* Woof Elf longbowman +50p. 

I'll have the scribes online before registration opens tomorrow night.

-Ross

The Lair of the Dragon will now reduce food production by 30%, up from 20%.

-Ross


# Rounds 40 - 39

Missing info


# Round 38

Below are the planned changes for round 38...one change I think would be pretty neat, but that I did not complete for this round, was allowing realms to have multiple wonders. I worry that a single realm will wind up with many wonders and become relatively unstoppable...I don't really know how to get around that. Perhaps by giving other realms bonuses against that realm based on number of wonders owned...I'd like to hear discussion about it. Perhaps for a future round. 

Anyways, the changes: 

* Farms produce 80 bushels, up from 40 

* Factories reduces costs by 4 * percentage to 80% from 3 * percentage to 75% 

* Diamond mines produce 15 gems up from 14 

* Guard Towers increase power by 1.75 * percentage to 35% down from 2 * percentage to 35% 

* Gryphon Nests increase power by 1.75 * percentage to 35% down from 2 * percentage to 35% 

* Forges & Walls maximum bonus +10%, but it will be harder to accumulate these bonuses 

* Wonder Guild of Shadows +50% spy strength up from +25% 

* Wonder Hanging Gardens +50% food production up from +30% 

* Factory of Legends: -25% construction costs up from -15% 

* Onyx Mausoleum: Attackers suffer +25% more casualties up from +10% 

* Prestige per 250 bonus will increase to +1.5% max population, +1.5% food production, and +1.5% attacking strength up from +1%/+1%/+1% 

* Defensive casualties will be reduced by half 

* Exploring costs will increase a bit past 5000 acres 

* Nox nightshade +100p 

* Orc prestige bonus removed 

* Fools Gold will protect platinum 10 hours, up from 8 hours

-Ross

Forges and Walls now have a maximum bonus of 30%. Accumulating these bonuses are more difficult.

-Ross


# Round 37

Main changes either missing or non-existant.

One additional change:

Orcs will have 125% attacking prestige gains, down from 150%.

-Ross

Clarification:

Round 37 will have nearly the same rules as Round 35. That is, assume all the rules from Round 35 are now in place, and all rules from Round 36 are not. 

The only exception is that, like in round 36, you still must continue to associate your lifetime account within the first 2 weeks of registering your dominion. 

The only changes I am adding from the round 35 rules are the following: 

* Lycanthrope lose the +15% platinum bonus. 

* Land automatically generated from attacking will increase from 10% to 15%.

-Ross


# Round 36

I said I was going to shake things up this round, and here it goes. 

I am currently planning to make the following changes, which are not yet final, as usual, and themselves subject to change until the round begins. I may not keep any of these changes past this next round. This round is going to just be something different. 

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR FAVORITE RACE(S) ARE NOT AS STRONG AS BEFORE OR TOO WEAK RELATIVE TO CHANGES IN OTHER RACES THAT THESE ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE PERMANENT CHANGES, AND/OR THEY WILL BE REBALANCED IN FURTHER ROUNDS.

* Orc lose 150% attacking prestige gain bonus. 

* Smithies will reduce costs by 1.8 * % to a maxinum of 36%, down from 2 * % to 40%. 

* Docks will now only protect 2 boats apiece, down from 2.5. 

* Guard Towers and Gryphon Nests will now produce a bonus of 1.8 * % to a maximum of 36%, down from 2 * % to 40%. 

* Forest Havens lose the platinum theft ability. 

* Forest Havens also now reduce casualties on defense by 4 * % to a maximum of 80%. 

* Shrines gain the ability to increase prestige gained on attacks by 1.5 * %, to a maximum of 40%. 

* Temples now reduce defensive bonuses by 1.5 * %, down from 1.75 * %. 

* Irrigation and Towers maximum bonus is now 50%, down from 60%. 

* Science, Forges and Walls maximum bonus is now 15%, down from 20%. 

* Keep maximum bonus is now 25%, down from 30%. 

* Human Knight is now 2/5, 900p, 90r, same ability. (cheaper, less powerful defense) 

* Cavalry is now 6/2, 1200r, 80r, same ability. (cheaper, less powerful defense) 

* Cavalry becomes a 7/2 monster if you have the Tactical Battle tech. Neigh! 

* Dwarf Cleric is now 4/4*, 1000p, 25r, same ability. (more powerful offense, more expensive) 

* Dwarf Warrior is now 7/2, 1400p, 150r (price increase) 

* Dwarf Warrior gains the ability: 8/2 against evil, but casualties increase by 50% for the Warriors (in other words, you will want to send them with Clerics). 

* Wood Elf Mystic price increased to 1100p. 

* Wood Elf Druid now 4*/0, increases power by 1 for every 25% forest, 1350p, 0r (no defense, more offense but more expensive and requires more forests) 

* Halfling Staff Master price increased by 75p. 

* Halfling Staff Master loses the 15% fewer casualties ability 

* Halfling Staff Master becomes 6/3 (instead of 5/3) if you have the Spy Master tech. 

* Master Thief loses it's 2 offensive strength. 

* Sylvan Dryad counts as a full wizard on defense if you have the Enchanted Lands tech. 

* Gnome spell Mechanical Genius is now changed to: when cast, if your attacking army is comprosed of 75% juggernauts or higher, Juggernauts gain +.5 offense apiece and target walls bonus is reduced to 0. 

* Gnome Juggernaut price increased by 100r. 

* Firewalker Salamander gains 1 offensive point per 5% of target's forests if target is evil, max +1. If target is good there is no bonus. 

* Goblin Shaman price reduced 25p. 

* Goblin Hobgoblin plunder is increased by 50% if you have the Treasure Hunter tech. 

* Troll Basher is now 5*/3, instead of 5*/2*, and loses it's special ability. The ore cost is reduced by 50p. 

* Troll Smasher loses it's special ability, and its ore cost is reduced by 50p. 

* If you have the Conqueror's Craft's tech, Basher and Smasher both have offensive strength increased by 1. 

* Dark Elf Spirit Warrior price is increased 150p. If Dark Artistry tech is owned, Spirit Warrior offensive strength is increased by 1. 

* Undead Vampire gets far more complicated. Vampire will now never convert to Ghouls and Skeletons, just Progeny. However, if you have the Magical Weaponry and Dark Artistry techs, Vampire conversions are reduced by 50% but all conversions become Vampires. In addition to this, if you have just the Dark Artistry tech, Vampires will gain the ability to increase in power by +1 for every 20% wizard guilds owned, maximum +2. Complicated enough? 

* Lycanthrope Ratman price increased 75p. 

* Lycanthrope Werewolf is now 4/4 (from 3/4), and ability reduced to 25% fewer casualties on offense and defense. The price is increased 125p. 

* Lycanthrope Werewolf also gain the ability to convert casualties to Werewolves. 

* Lycanthrope Garou loses it's special ability. 

* Lycanthrope Garou gains +1 offense if your target is of good alignment. 

* Kobold Overlord gains 2.5, instead of 2, offensive power for each Grunt being sent that matches an Overlord, if you have the Fruits of Labor tech. 

* Lizardfolk Chameleon is now 4*/4, and Chameleon offense increases by 1 for each 5% of target's water, if the target is not a Merfolk, max +1. 

* Icekin FrostMage defense now increases power by 1 for every 15% mountains, down from 20%. 

* Orc Voodoo Magi reduce all casualties taken (on either offense or defense, regardless of the fact that they cannot be sent on offense) by .75% * the percentage they make up of your army. 

* Nox Lich gains 1 offensive power if you control the Dark Artistry tech. 

And that is that. For now. I'm curious to hear feedback. There are a few changes in here I think might be a bit powerful. But balancing some of the tech requirements with the slower start necessitates giving a decent bonus because players are playing catch up. 

I think the Vampire change could go either way. It requires 2 big techs instead of 1, and to get full use of it you really have to also control a fair number of wizard guilds, which serve little other purpose. The Spirit Warrior becomes kind of a monster once the tech is acquired. The same is true for the Troll Smasher, who now has a bonus against everybody, and the Human Cavalry. The two that probably nag at me the most right now are the Gnome Juggernaut, which doesn't require a tech, and the Dwarf Cleric/Warrior combo, which also does not require a tech. With the dwarves, they have to at least send out a good amount of defense if they are going to prevent heavy losses to the Warriors. With the Gnomes...the only thing I've done to them is remove the attack strength and gem bonuses, and increase the cost of the juggernaut. But the Juggernaut could get big and ugly. Gnomes haven't been performing particularly well, though.

-Ross

* The original changes listed the troll smasher ore cost as -50p, when it should have read -50r. 

* The Undead Vampire will work as follows: 

- If you own no techs, all conversions are progeny. 
- If you own Dark Artistry, Vampires will gain the ability to increase in power by +1 for every 20% wizard guilds owned, maximum +2. 
- If you then acquire the Magical Weaponry tech, the prior ability of increase in power by wizard guilds is removed. Instead, Vampires will convert to Vampires, instead of banshees, at a rate of 75% (this is increased from last changes) of prior conversions. 

-Lizardfolk Chameleon is now 4*/4, and Chameleon offense increases by 1 for each 5% of target's water, if the target is not a Merfolk ---or Lizardfolk---, max +1. 

-Icekin Frostmage will not change as stated. 

-Icekin Ice Elemental will now be 4*/2, and increase in power by .7 * Raw Wizard Ratio, maximum +3.5. 

-Nox Nightshade will now increase per 12.5% constructed swamp buildings, up from 10%, and will cost an additional 100p. 

-Human Cavalry will require both Tactical Battle AND Conqueror's Crafts in order to gain the increase in power. 

-Gnome spell Mechanical Genius will only increase the power of the Juggernaut by .5, and not affect target walls.

-Ross

I expect this is the last of the changes. 

* You may only associate a lifetime account with your dominion during it's first 2 weeks. 

* Firewalker and Lizardfolk new abilities will be contingent on constructed forest and constructed water buildings, respectively. Barren land and buildings under construction will not count. 

* Mechanical Genius is being changed again. After further reflection, it is simply: If Juggernauts make up 75% of your army or larger, you gain 10% attack strength. 

* Troll Smasher defense is reduced from 7 to 6, and I decided against reducing the Smasher's ore cost. 

* Firewalker spell Alchemist Flame will increase alchemy output by 10p, down from 15p.

# Round 35

Missing info


# Round 34

There aren't going to be many changes for the coming round. Most of this stuff doesn't really affect gameplay, and is just sort of peripheral game-related stuff. There's nothing I want to do to the races right now, and I'd like to focus on making the op center even better, and make the experience better for new players so we can try to increase the playerbase. The new changes are not yet online. 

Anyways, the changes: 

* Destroying a wonder in realm 0 will not grant 100 prestige - only destroying a wonder in a real realm. 

* Titan, Dragon, and Planewalker have been removed from the Search page, and the Planewalker references are removed from the scribes war page. 

* Disclosure and Clairvoyance have been added to the op center. 

* Quicklinks to the op center are now available on the Realm page. The Realm page will now display the number of ops your realm has on a target dominion (that you can view), and will link directly to that player in your op center. 

* The scribes will now be searchable via a little google searchbox. I'm not sure how effective this will be, but it can't hurt. 

* I'm adding a Question and Answer function, in which players will be able to ask a question, and anyone will be able to answer. I'll select the most appropriate answer to the question, and the questioner will receive the response, while the person with the best answer will receive some kind of bonus (5 or 10 prestige, likely). These questions and answers will be searchable so that people can find answers to common questions. 

* I still need to get some kind of newbie strategy guide. I know I mentioned this before, and it's something I still need. Please contact me if you would like to put something together - I can provide the proper style, but I need the textual content. I am not averse to putting up multiple guides if multiple people have worthwhile things to offer. 

The previous 3 items are obviously aimed at newcomers. Unless you come to Dominion from a similar game, Dominion is a rather unfriendly game to pick up. Many people simply give up because they do not understand how to play, and I'd like to try to change that. 

That's really all I have planned for Round 34, but if you have any minor gameplay tweaks you want to suggest, I could still add to these changes.

-Ross


# Server Migration

The new server is now up and running! Registration should be underway later this week. Please let me know on the General Messageboard how your connection is. 

Dominion:Classic is up and running from the end of last round. Please log in and play a bit for testing purposes and let me know if you have any problems on the bugs messageboard.

-Ross


# Round 33

Missing info


# Round 32?

The following are my planned changes for Classic. There aren't tons, but the ones here are significant. Registration, however, will unfortunately not open until sometime this weekend - likely Sunday. The complexity of some of these changes and real-life commitments prevent me from beginning registration sooner. 

* Like in Liege Lord, there will now be a rankings advisor that displays where you rank in each category. If this causes undue strain on the server I may have to pull this feature mid-round. 

* Wonders will be skewed to appear more towards the beginning of the round. 

* Relation duration is now a minimum of 72 hours, up from 48. 

* During the first 24 hours of a peace or war declaration, no attack, defense, land gain, or attacking prestige bonuses will apply. War operations WILL be permitted during this time, however. After 24 hours, all standard diplomacy bonuses will be in effect. 

* There will be new functionality in place to prevent out of protection farming. We'll see how it goes. 

* Players joining mid-round will be seeded towards lower realms rather than the realms at higher numbers. I have yet to decide what to do about those who remain in the upper levels. 

* Gnome Juggernaut will be 7 power against dominions 85% of your size or greater, down from 90% or greater. 

* Orc Voodoo Magi will increase in power for every 600 prestige, down from 750 prestige (max +2 as before). 

* Merfolk will gain +15% food production. 

* A new ops center will be provided within your realm. All information gathering ops performed successfully within your realm will appear in the ops center for 2 days before they are automatically purged. The ops will be divided by type of operation and ordered by date. I may divide the ops into land ranges as well for quicker access (ie, all the ops on dominions of specific land ranges will be grouped together). At some point in the future (not this round), I may require that a certain number of operations against a dominion be required from your realm before they can be attacked, or to reduce a penalty for attacking without ops. This was a suggestion from a long time ago that I always liked, but I may never implement that. It is my hope that the ops center will lead to significantly more cooperation in-realm. 

* I am also in need of help...the scribes aren't really in the state they should be in. I know there are probably errors, out-of-date information, and things missing. If there are people interested in helping fix the scribes, I would be interested in your input. I will post a thread about this over the weekend on the General Discussion board. 

* I am also looking for someone (or several people) to write a newbie strategy guide and tip sheet. Ideally I'd like a new player to be able to be a decent explorer or decent attacker, but information about converters for this guide would be a bonus. I see no reason why someone in their first or second round should not be able to reach 2k acres or more. This is probably a lot more work than helping scrub the scribes. While I only need input on the scribes, this is something I'd expect someone (or a group of someones) to write on their own and submit to me. In exchange for this work (which you agree would become property of Kamikaze Games once submitted), I would offer these players 2 rounds of premium access, or perhaps more, depending on the quality of the guide and how many people work on it (by this I mean that 1 person writing a 20 page guide would get more rounds than 10 people writing the same guide). It can be written in Notepad - I can convert this to the proper formatting. If you are interested, I will post a thread about this on the General Messageboard this weekend to see who is interested. I will decide there which player or group of players is given the task (there is no sense in having 50 different people submit me 50 different guides). I don't think an individual strategy or strategies are necessary for each race, but that is something that couldn't hurt if enough players had the time.

-Ross

I forgot to mention: 

* Lower spy and wizard losses on failed operations. All spies die at a flat rate regardless of operation performed. 

I have also built in the following features to the Op Center: 

* You cannot view the op center while in protection. 

* All ops viewable to you are restricted to your 40-167% range. Ops in the center outside of this range you will be unable to view. 

* You will be able to select a delay on the magic and espionage pages in posting your ops to the ops center - no delay, 15 minutes, and one hour. This preference will be saved for you automatically when you complete an operation. All information ops WILL be posted to the center, but if you are terribly concerned with someone "stealing" your target than you can set a delay as to when your op will be posted.

# Round 29

Round 29 changes, with comments from Urg the Troll in brackets. 

Probably not too many giant changes this time around due to the previous unbalanced round. [Urg like old changes. No change Troll, or Urg smash Ross.] 

There are a number of things I would like to try but that won't be ready in time for the coming round. I've tabled those items for further development, but I've got at least a couple of neat dynamics changes below. [Get to changes, or I smash you.] 

First, I fixed several small issues: 

* Halfing Spy Ratio in the Advisors were off. [Urg hate filthy stealing halflings.] 

* Randomer seeding once the game started has been properly done. [Give Urg allies to help smash.] 

* Networth updates show now always be accurate. I hope. I could never find the error with this code, so I just deleted it all and recoded the whole thing. I hope it works now. [Urg smash Ross for not fixing sooner.] 

* You should now always be able to release spies, wizards and archmages when you have reached the maximum release power. Previously, sometimes it wouldn't let you release any of these units even though they are 0 power. [Urg smash them like bugs.] 

* Wonder damage is now fixed. Previously, any war declaration reset the damage your realm was doing to a wonder, even if you were attacking the same one as before. [Urg smash temples, lairs, obelisks, monuments, and all buildings me no like.] 

* Exile votes for monarch should now be eliminated. [Urg no vote. Urg smash.] 

* The default diplomacy option has been changed to cancel relations to prevent accidental war declarations. [Urg declare war on you. Then Urg smash you again and again. Urg make nice relations.] 

* I've added the clock, a counter for days into the round, and your daily bonus status under the resources bar at the top of every page. [Urg sleepy.] 

Some actual dynamics changes: 

* The method for calculating success & failure on blackops has been slightly tweaked. I'm hoping this leads to more accurate success and failure rates. [Urg sleep and wait for better changes.] 

* Relations have been beefed up a bit...One way war will give +10% land gains on attacks, mutual war +15% land gains on attacks, and a war/peace will cancel the extra land gain bonus. [Urg like land.] 

* I'm going to try out some artificial land gain for a round and see how it goes. Successful attacks, in addition to taking the standard amount of land that you would have gotten last round from your target, will also generate another 10% bonus in land. This means if your attack would normally take 100 land from your opponent, it will still take 100 land, but it will also generate an additional 10. I don't know if this will be a permanent feature or not. [Urg still like land.] 

* Some of the bigger techs have been beefed up a bit. Fruits of Labor will be +25% lumber, +25% ore, +15% gems, up from +20, +20, +15. Urban Mastery will increase population maximum by +6%, up from +5%. Treasure Hunt will increase platinum production by +12.5%, up from +10%. Conqueror's Crafts will reduce construction and rezoning costs by -40%, up from -30%. [Urg no study. Urg have no techs. Urg find schools and smash them.] 

* Wonders have been modified to not appear at the start of the round. There will now be a random time at which wonders will appear. They will appear one by one, on any random day during the round. Not all of them will appear during the course of the round. On average, roughly 2/3 of existing wonders will appear. Once a wonder appears, it is placed in Realm 0, and it's available for the rest of the round. [Urg confused by long explanation.] 

* I'm going to try another change that I don't know if I'm going to make permanent...I'm going to scale down black op damage based on prestige ratios OR size ratios, so dominions with small prestige relative to large prestige will do less damage on their ops. This is just like the land ratio scale that is used now. What I plan to do is just use the lower of the two ratios. So normally what happens now is that a dominion with 100 land uses a spy or magic op on a dominion with 200 land, and since the size ratio is 1:2, they do half damage. And vice versa, if the 200 land dominion uses ops on the 100 land dominion. So, in addition, I am going to compare the prestige ratios. If the 100 land dominion has 100 prestige, and the 200 land dominion has 400 prestige, that's a 4:1 ratio. Since this ratio is bigger than the land ratio, I will use this one instead of the land ratio (25% of normal damage instead of the land ratio's half). But that's not going to always be true. :) The one difference is that if the prestige ratio is used, the maximum reduction in effectiveness will be 30% (70% of normal damage), whereas there is no cap on the land ratio reduction. This means in the previous example, the damage would not be reduced to 25% of normal if the prestige ratio were used...it would be instead reduced to 70% of normal. However, since the land ratio is 1:2, 50% of damage is lower than 70%, so 50% would be used. [Urg so confused. Urg not understand what this for.] The reason behind all of this is that I agree that it's sort of silly for explorers to have a significant advantage against attackers in this area. Attackers should have more prestige than explorers, so the explorer/attacker blackop damage on the same land size will probably use the prestige ratio for calculating reduced damage between these dominions. [Urg still no get it, but trust Ross knows. Or me smash him later.] 

* There aren't many race changes. It's really hard to tell what to change when one or two races are really dominating. Part of the reason that trolls did so well this round was simply because an awful lot of people played them. They weren't really as overpowered as they appeared, but enough so that the rankings are heavily skewed by player selection. By changing the Trolls, I have to change a few other races as well. I hope after these few race changes the rest of the races should be fairly balanced with one another, but I'll have to wait and see. [Urg want to see.] 

* Troll: Smasher +200p. [Urg smash Ross into thousand tiny pieces. Then Urg smash pieces into thousand tiny pieces. Then Urg take pieces of pieces and smash those. Then Urg find wizard, make Ross whole again so Urg can smash him again.] 

* Kobold Grunt +25p, Overlord +25p. [Urg still busy smashing Ross.] 

* Goblin Wolf Rider +50r. This will probably be an unpopular one...the fast rise in DPA early is often due to Goblins, but I don't want to completely kill their fast start, as they need it. [Urg no care about stupid Goblins.] 

* I'm also considering some other alternatives for acquiring premium accounts...there is nothing ready at the moment, but there may be something before next round.

-Ross

* I've also modified the networth of several units in order to more accurately reflect this overall value. Every unit will now have a static networth.

-Ross

Kobold Overlord should be +50p, not +25p. This is a reversal of last round's modification.

-Ross


# Round 28?

Urg is sleeping and is unavailable for commentary. 

These are the the projected changes for Round 28, and as always are subject to modification, addition, etc: 

* Daily land bonus is being increased from 15 to 20 land. 

* Guard Towers and Gryphon nests now have a maximum of 40% bonus, down from 60%. 

* Smithy bonus is now 2 * (Smithies / Total Land) % to a maximum of 40%, instead of 1.5 * to a maximum of 50%. 

* Barracks will now hold 36 military units instead of 38. 

* Diamond Mines will produce 14 gems, up from 12. 

* Temples will increase population growth rate by 6 * (temples / total land) % up from 4 *. 

* Tech costs have been reduced by 15%. 

* The default resource selected on the investment page is now gems. 

* Merfolk Kraken -50p. 

* Spirit/Undead can now convert at 65% instead of 70%, and Spectres/Vampires convert roughly 10% more troops. 

* Lycanthrope Garou now converts roughly 12% more Werewolves. 

* Troll Smasher -200p. 

* The Gnome self spell now reduces rezoning costs by 30%, instead of 10%. 

* The Troll self spell now reduces casualties by 25%, instead of 10%. 

* Undead get another +5% mana production. 

* Nomad get another +5% mana production. 

* Dark Elf Spirit Warrior will now be 6.5/0 against Dominions 85% of your size or higher. 

* Orc BoneBreaker will be reduced by every 10% guard towers of the defender, down from 15%, to reflect the new guard tower cap of 40%. 

* Dark Elf Adept is now 2*/4*, with a new maximum of 7/9, up from 1*/4*, 6/9. 

* Nox get +5% population. 

* Halfling now consumes -30% food, from -10% consumption. 

* Goblin Wolf Rider -100p. 

* Goblin Hobgoblin -75p. 

* Orc Bone Breaker -100p, -10r. 

* Kobold Grunt -25p. 

* Kobold Overlord -50p. 

* Lizardfolk Lizardman -100p. 

* Lifetime ranks now record your race selection from the round.

-Ross

The Goblin Wolf Rider will no longer get the previously announced -100p. Relative with the other changes, Goblin has already been made better and I feel that this change gives them too quick a start and will push defense levels up more quickly early in the game.

-Ross


# Round 27

As always, the following list is subject to change (addition, modification, deletion)...these are the expected changes right now. Comments in brackets by Urg the troll. 

* There are now no more registration 'waves'. Everyone will start at the same time. [Urg hate water of any kind. Urg no swim, Urg sink.] 

* Realm Improvements have been removed for this round, but may return in the future. [Urg no need silly wooden machine. Urg smash well alone.] 

* You can no longer attack members of your own realm. [Urg hate peoples. All peoples. Less peoples to smash make Urg angry.] 

* You can no longer perform damaging spell and spy operations on members of your own realm. [Urg break wizards in many pieces. Urg smash spies like ants under feet. Urg laugh.] 

* Registration has been rebalanced to try to evenly distribute randomers with those who pack together. This means less packs should be grouped with one another to prevent realm imbalance. [Urg not understand. Urg smash all peoples anyway.] 

* Attack rankings have been fixed to include all land gained from attacks, not just 75% of your size and up. [Urg like when peoples know how many he smashed. Urg good at smashing.] 

* Players joining after day 1 will begin with more troops and resources (scaled upwards based on days into the round) in an effort to give them a better start. [Urg think more peoples to smash a good thing.] 

* Wood Elf networth has been inflated a bit as I think they were misrepresented. [Urg hate tree huggers. Not strong. They weak, and Urg smash them at earliest time he can.] 

* There will a new method that allows a realm to vote to exile a member of the realm. It will require 60% of the realm members to vote for exile. The exiled realm member will be randomly placed into another realm. [Urg smash peoples he no like. Urg no like sending non-smashed peoples away.] 

* I am considering disallowing players from deleting their accounts if they have been invaded successfully within the period 12 hours prior to their attempted deletion in an attempt to prevent farming. [Urg hate farmers. Urg hunt. Eat meat. Good for Urg.] 

* Race changes: 

Goblin: Gain castle investment bonus of 5%. For example, if you were investing 100 points worth of improvements, you would really get 105. 

Merfolk: Leviathan -50p. 

Firewalker: Salamander -50p. 

Halfling: Staff Master -25r. Master Thief -30r. 

Sylvan: Dryad -50p. 

Dark Elf: Spirit Warrior -50p. 

Kobold: Overlord -50p. 

Lizardfolk: +5% max population. 

Orc: Bloodrage now increases casualties by 10% instead of 20%. Lumber production bonus increased to 50% from 30%. 

That's how things are looking at the moment. I hope to have registration up either tonight (unlikely) or tomorrow night (more probable). [Urg need to smash now. Delay angers Urg. Urg smash Ross.]

-Ross

Not realizing how popular the wave function is with premium account holders, I've put the waves back in.

-Ross

## Modifications

Instead of no damaging in realm magic and spy operations, I'm not going to allow any in-realm operations of any kind.

-Ross

Slightly different than the previously announced method of exile, the exile functionality will now not be voted on. Exile will now be automatic. Inactive Dominions of small size will now be removed from your realms in regular intervals.

-Ross

# Liege Lord Introduction

Big news. I'm now opening a BETA round for a Dominion Variant that will run concurrently with the current Dominion game (henceforth Dominion Classic) called Dominion: Liege Lord. I've spent a good deal of time on it, and hopefully it's ready to roll. But with a project of this magnitude I'm sure there are some bugs to be worked out. 

There's a good number of differences to the game. First, it will run twice as long as the normal round. Second, realms have been removed and replaced by alliances...which are built by the players and have no size limit. These are major changes in and of themselves. There are lots of dynamics changes to go along with the longer round. Troops are significantly more expensive, as are all the costs within the game. Attack gains have been reduced, as have casualties. Spy and wizard operations have been weakened. The game also introduces the Fiefdom concept. Your fiefdom consists of players you refer to the game (your Bannermen), and your Liege Lord (the person who referred you to the game, if any). This is a tiered bonus system you can read about in the BETA, but will mitigate the cost increases you will see (which are quite large). 

You can read a short summary of the game differences here:

To sign up for the BETA, go here:

Of important note that currently in the BETA you can only have a limited number of Bannermen (right now set at 3). This number may increase as the BETA continues and the limit will be removed when Round 1 opens. 

Currently I do not know how long the BETA will run. It could be a week, it could be a month, it could be longer. 

Please post comments to the general messageboard and all bugs to the Bugs messageboard. Hope you have fun.

# Round 25

A preamble to the changes... 

The server is kind of in a bad way lately...I'm hoping this gets resolved soon...this week, I would hope, but it's out of my hands. I will probably delay the start of round 25 until after the hardware gets replaced because I don't want the server to go down for hours during protection or the first week of the round when it's obviously the most important. With that said, I'll probably get the changes online as soon as I can and unpause the game and let people play until the server is fixed. 

I'm not planning to put up any LL changes until the server is fixed. All the announced changes were completed already...weeks ago. But due to the intermittent downtime I haven't put them online. I'd rather wait until everything is working properly before I get them online. With that said, they probably won't go online until after Classic Round 25 is up and running for a week. 

In regards to the round 25 changes...there's less here than I would like because my schedule has been increasily taxing the past few months. I think I've addressed several areas that needed attention, however. As some of you have noticed, I was unable to update the storyline this round. Again, a result of my schedule. I am considering allowing player submitted storylines this round in an effort to enhance your game experience and at the same time allow me to not worry about it myself. I haven't made a final decision on that yet. 

The changes, which, as always, are themselves subject to change before the round begins: 

From LL now to Classic: 

* Default 'enter key' on the Realm page will perform the change realm function instead of previous realm function. This is more of a bug fix than anything else. 

* Wizard Guilds will no longer increase Wizard Power. I'd really like to give the Wizard Guilds some additional power but I haven't come up with anything good. 

* Non-Archmage Wizards of all kinds will die on failed spell attempts. 

All new for Classic: 

* Earthquake is now a war-only spell. 

* Several of the stronger techs have been weakened a bit: 

~ Tech Fruits of Labor ore and lumber bonuses reduced to +20% from +30%. 

~ Tech Magical Weaponry now reduces military cost by 10% from 15%. 

~ Tech Urban Mastery now increases population by 5% from 7.5%. 

~ Tech Treasure Hunt now increases plat production by 10% from 15%. 

* Schools will now produce research points in decreasing effectiveness. The new formula for research point production is the larger of schools/2 and schools * (1 - (schools/total land)). This means if you had 100 schools on 1000 land, you get the maximum value between 50 and 100 * (1 - .1) = 90, so 90. If you had 200 schools, max of 100 and 200 * (1 - .2) = 160, so 160. 300 schools would give 210 points, 400 would give 240 points, 500 would give 250 points, 600 would give 300 points. And so on. This should help encourage growth rather than sitting at low acres teching...I'd credit somebody for this suggestion but it was given by multiple people. 

* The 2:1 rule has been scrapped and replaced by Talium's 4:3 suicide rule, which is really a better method for preventing suicides...The 4:3 rule is simply: You cannot send more than 133% offense out relative to the defense you leave at home. So if you send 13,333 modified offense out, your remaining modified defense at home has to be at least 10,000. This doesn't prevent you from sending out all your offense if you wanted...if you had 40,000 offense and 10,000 defense, you could send out 13,333 multiple times (as long as you leave the 10,000 defense at home), but you couldn't send 40,000 in one shot. You must still always leave at least 33% of your defense at home. That rule remains. 

* Race Changes: 

~ Kobold: Lose the -5% population they gained during last round's changes. 

~ Kobold: Like LL, gain another 10% population growth rate. 

~ Gnome: Tinker now 0/3 from 0/2.5, +50p. 

~ Nox: Nightshade -100r. Now increases by every 10% swamp buildings instead of 15% swamp buildings. 

~ Nox: Lich -100p. 

~ Firewalker: Salamander now has no ore cost (down 100r to 0r). 

~ Lycanthrope: Ratman -50p. 

~ Orc: Prestige attack gains are doubled. If your realm happens to own the Golden Throne, this bonus is multiplicative.

-Ross

Both techs Master of Resources and Magical Weaponry were reduced. Troop cost to -10% and Attack bonus to +10%.

-Ross


# Round 24

Almost all of this round's changes deal with the races...I did a number of things behind the scenes that nobody cares about right now so I won't mention them here, but "big things are coming". For now, this is what is changed for Round 24: 

* No dragons, no titans, no planewalkers, no storyline races. And there was much rejoicing. 

* Halfling spy strength from +10% to +30%. 
* Halfling Master Thief from 3/4 spy on offense, full spy on defense to 1/5 spy on offense, 1/2 spy on defense 
* Halfling Master Thief -125p 
* Demoralize spy operation has been removed 

* Lizardfolk Chameleon from 1/2 spy to 1/5 spy. 
* Lizardfolk Chameleon -75p. 
* Lizardfolk Lizardmen -100p. 

* Dwarf Cleric -100p. 

* Kobold +5% population. 

* Lycanthrope Garou slightly increased conversions. 

* Goblin Gem production +15% from +10%. 

* Gnome can now use barracks. 

* Dark Elf can now use barracks. 

* Forest Havens must now be destroyed like Guard Towers on the Military Release page. 

* New race, for Premium only players: The Nox. Players who have had premium access applied to their account may use the account options to restart as this race. This race is subject to all the packing and alignment restrictions of any other race. ANY Premium player may select to use this race as per those restrictions. 

* The Nox: 
Alignment - Evil 
Homes - Swamps 
+10% mana production, -20% food consumption 
Imp: 3/0, 300p,0r 
Fiend: 0/3, 325p, 25r 
Nightshade: 0/2*, 700p, 200r, * Increases by 1 for every 15% CONSTRUCTED swamp buildings, maximum 6. 
Lich: 4*/2, 1200p,0r, Only dies (as normal units) on attacking losses against Evil races, -50% casualties vs Good races, * Lich has 5 power against Good races 

To clarify, against Good races, the Lich is 5/2 and suffers 50% casualties on offense and defense. Against Evil races, the Lich is 4/2 and only dies when attacking, and ONLY if the battle is lost. The Lich is not subject to the SPUD rules in any way. 

Spell - Nightfall: +5% attack strength 

I'm interested in balancing this race with all the rest, so I'd like feedback on what you think. I considered making the Nightshade per 10% constructed swamp buildings, but this is the race as it is at present. The idea here right now is that the Nox will run a decent percentage of Temples, most likely, so they will be facing little to no mods on defense when attacking...and I would imagine most Nox players would be attacking Good races most of the time since the Lich is a 5 instead of a 4, and a 5 point attacker against a player with no D mods should be plenty sufficient.

-Ross


# Round 23

Preliminary list of changes, subject to modification/addition/etc: 

* Much rejoicing, the Dragons and Titans are being removed. Don't get too excited just yet. 

* Replacing the Dragons and the Titans will be 20 Planewalkers, who are returning to the game after a 15 round hiatus. 

* Realm size is being reduced from 20 to 10. Just because. 

* Building changes (hopefully to at least diversify some strategies): 
-Alchemy: Now will produce 45 platinum. 
-Smithy: Now will reduce costs by 1.5 * instead of 1.2 *. 
-Gryphon Nest & Guard Tower: Power will now be 1.75 * and 2 *, up from 1.5 * and 1.75 *. 
-Shrine bonus will now reduce casualties by 5 * instead of 4 *. 
-Temples will increase growth rate by 4 * instead of 3 *, and the bonus reduction will be 1.5 * instead of 1.3 *. 
-Masonries will increase bonuses by 2 * down from 2.5 *. 

* Tech Changes (the bigger techs get bigger): 
-Fruits of Labor bonuses increased 50%. 
-Dark Artistry bonus increased 50%. 
-Urban Mastery bonus increased 50%. 
-Treasure Hunt bonus increased 50%. 
-Magical Weapons bonus increased 50%. 
-Conqueror's Craft bonus increased 50%. 
-Master of Resources bonus increased 50%. 
-Tactical Battle: no change. 
-Enchanted Lands: -20% exploring cost from -15%, +15% mana production from +10%. 

* Race Changes: 
-Spirit/Undead: Lose +5% defense bonus. 

That's it for the race changes, for now anyways. There might be more, or there might not be. 

* Planewalkers: You'll be able to get full details on the planewalkers when the scribes go up. They will be nearly identical in form to the previous Planewalkers, however the elite units will be 1000p, down from the original 1200p, they will not need boats, and they will not have the -5% max population penalty. Otherwise they are pretty much the same. In other words, though slightly stronger than they were before, they are still much, much weaker than the immortal, cheap and strong Dragons and Titans. 

* Storyline implications: Because the Planewalkers will be weaker than the previous storyline races, the 4 day attack rule will not apply to them. Further, they will not create any land...their hits will be just like any other. However, reduced casualties will still remain in effect. They will also still cause Fear. 

* Storyline bonus: This will now be independent of the storyline races. There will still be 20 storyline races, 10 in each of realm 1 and 2. However, the storyline bonus will be based on total good land size versus total evil land size. The bonus will go to the race that is currently on the lower side of the overall rankings. In other words, if Good has more land than Evil, then Evil will have a bonus in attacking Good. How this bonus will be calculated will probably be similar to the way it is calculated right now, if not identical.

-Ross

* Alchemist Flame will produce an additional 15p instead of 20p, due to Alchemy change. 

* Temple of Equality will act like 5% temples instead of 10%, due to Temple change. 

* Orc Voodoo Magi will be 0/3*, * Increases by 1 for every 10% shrines, max + 2. 

* Planewalker elites will be 1200p after all, instead of 1000p. 

For those who didn't know, here's what the Planewalkers look like: 

Elemental: 6 0 Not Trainable, Maximum 3 per Summoner (Summoners at home control Elementals home AND away) 

Golem: 0 6 Not Trainable, Maximum 3 per Conjurer 

Summoner: 0 1 Counts as 1/3 wizard, Summons one Elemental for every 20 controlled per hour (up to draft rate, out of draftees), One must attack with every 3 Elementals 1200p, 0r 

Conjurer: 0 1 Counts as 1/3 wizard, Summons one Golem for every 20 controlled per hour (up to draft rate, out of draftees) 1200p, 0r 

19 Summoners or Conjurers will create ZERO units. It takes the full 20 to create a unit. If Conjurers or Summoners are killed beyond the 3:1 cap, the Golems and Elementals do not disappear, you just won't be able to create more. Summoners will die when they attack. 

Spell: 
Elemental Protection: PLANEWALKER ONLY, SELF - Reduces summoner losses on attack by 50% (only if battle won) 

+10% wizard strength 
Can't build homes or barracks 

Their racial properties will still remain like other storyline races: 
Can't join Elite Guard 
Can't attack Wonders 
Can't be demoralized 
Can't delete, defect, 
enter away mode 

They will still cause fear and be able to attack realm improvements.

-Ross

Wonders that read "Dragon" or "Titan" will now read "Planewalker".

-Ross

Ignore previous Orc changes. 

Orc Voodoo Magi will now be 0/3*, * Increases by 1 for every 10% schools, max +2.

-Ross


# Round 22

Below is the preliminary list of changes for Round 22. There's a lot of big stuff (I think, anyways) in there. I haven't finished testing yet, but I expect the changes to go up sometime on Saturday, if I had to guess. Could be Sunday. There may be additions or modifications to these changes. I'm going to print the changes in sort of a haphazard order... 


Realm Improvements: Costs have changed. Points of engines are now easier to obtain than points in fortresses. It used to be 2000 apiece, and now it's 1500 for the engines and 2500 for the fortresses. 

Forest Havens: Now protect population from fireballs using total population at home as a base to protect (this include military at home), rather than just the peasants. This makes the fireball protection actually useful. 

User verification: You will now be forced to verify your account on the very first log in to the game. This is partially to prevent realmhopping. 

Deletions: There will sometimes be a news item when people are deleted. 

Storyline Races: The 4-day attack limit will not apply to realms that have declared war on the Dragons or Titans. 

Spirits: Now good alignment. 

Nomads: Now evil alignment. 

Diamond Mine: Now produces 12 gems instead of 15. 

New Spell: Fool's Gold. This *8* hour spell, while expensive, will protect your dominion from plat theft for the duration of the spell. Completely. 

Monarch Platinum Bonus: Removed. 

Tech Tree: Almost completely overhauled. Implemented Sir G's Tech Tree (with a few changes). Most current techs are similar to the old techs. Some have been beefed up, and 6 new higher level techs have been added that allow for greater strategic variation (all from Sir G's outline). Full details on the tech tree will be available when the changes go online (with the scribes). 

Treasuries: Removed. 

New building: Schools. Built inside Caverns. Schools produce research points, at 1 point per school per hour. Research points, not land, are now used to gain techs. Tech costs scale with your land size. Roughly 10% of your land producing for a week is good enough for one tech at present. The upper-echelon techs are pretty good. I think you should have to work for them if you want them. Exact costs may change before the round begins. 

Fear: Fear is now more effective (formula changes to 8 times from 5). 

Starting Waves: Starting wave numbers have been changed to make earlier waves better (again, Sir G's numbers). 

Storyline Attacks: Storyline races take 80% land and create 20% (on retals) and 75% land and create 25% (on random hits), and casualties are now 80% of normal. This is an increase from the current levels. Blame Macros. 

Spy Losses: Reversed for failed spy/theft ops. Now spying losses are lower than theft losses. 

Realm Improvement Investing: After passing 500,000 points of invested resources, dominions will be limited in how much they can invest in realm improvements based on their land size relative to the realm land size. Credit Talium with this fix, though I know a lot of you posted similar ideas. As an example, if a dominion has 10% of their realm land, and has invested 0 resources, and the current investments total 500,000, they would be able to only invest a maximum of 55,000. This is because 55k/550k = 10%, which is the size of the dominion relative to the realm. You will be able to see how many resources everybody in your realm has invested. 

There are also a bunch of other small fixes not really worth mentioning. You will notice a distinct lack of race changes. Other than the alignment switch, there aren't any, and I'm not planning on any others for round 22. I don't think we've ever had 2 successive rounds in a row where there haven't been changes to most of the races, so I'm going to see how things turn out for the races after a second round with the same numbers for once.

-Ross

At land sizes under 1250 acres, construction build cost will still be determined by built land. It used to be that the minimum for the cost was half your land, whether it was built or not. Now it's 75%, to 1250 acres. 

Past 1250 acres, build cost is based on total land only, regardless of what you have built.

-Ross

Storyline races will cause 75%, not 80% of casualties, as previously stated. 

Tech costs will now be approximately 7.5% of your land for a week per tech gain, rather than the previously stated 10%.

-Ross

Fool's Gold may only be cast once every 20 hours.

-Ross

Fixed the few valid bugs being reported, and made the following change: 

* 7.5% land base for techs has been reduced to 5% to compensate for growth during the time of teching. 

* Tech minimum cost will be 4200 (this is just 5% of 500 land for a week).

-Ross


# Round 21

Base changes missing. Further changes:

* The effect of fear has been increased from .02 * fear/land % to .05 * fear/land %. 

* There will be no 4 day restriction for Dragons and Titans attacking one another. 

* Human/Nomad Cavalry/Valkyrie increased to 6/3 from 5/3, +200p, +20r. 

* Halfling Defender increased from 0/2 to 0/2.5, +50p.

-Ross


# Round 20

Below are the expected changes for Round 20. Any and all of this is subject to change and/or addition until the round begins. 

* Masonries will now have a 2.5 * % multiplier instead of 3 * %. 

* Building cost, platinum only, has been increased roughly 20%. 

* Factories are now 3 * % to 75% maximum, down from 4 * % to 80% maximum. 

* Treasuries are now 4 * % to 80% platinum protection. 

* Smithies now reduce unit costs by 1.2 * %, up from 1 * %, to the same maximum. 

* Dragons and Titans are being split into realms 1 and 2. They will be able to attack one another. The storyline bonus will now be automated, and will be a direct result of the ratio of land between the Dragons and the Titans. This means one of either Good or Evil aligned Dominions will have 0% bonus, while the other will have a positive bonus. The maximum bonus is 5%, and is calculated by every 10% land advantage the Titans or Dragons have over one another. 

In other words, if the Titans collectively have 1400 land and the Dragons collectively have 1000 land, then good dominions will have a 4% attack bonus and evil will have a 0% attack bonus. If Dragons have 2000 land and Titans 1000, evil would have a 5% attack bonus (capped), and good would have 0%. 

* 2 realmwide improvements have been added (vague references from good storyline): Siege Engines and Fortresses. These options can be found on the Improvements page. Only lumber may be invested in these two improvements. For every 500 lumber invested, these improvements are worth 1 offense (Siege Engines) or 1 defense (Fortresses) to EVERYONE in the realm. 

Specifics on the realm improvements: 
* Siege Engines do not count against wonders 
* They are only used on out of realm attacks 
* Land defense is calculated before any Fortress power is added 
* They ARE affected by attack and defense mods. 
* The exact ratings are displayed on every realm page, so no ops are needed to determine what ratings each realm has. 
* Offense and defense are CAPPED at 20% of your raw military strength. This means if you have 10,000 raw defense, but your realm has 20,000 defense in fortresses, you will only gain 2,000 defense from the fotresses of your realm. 
* Fortresses and Siege Engines are destroyed at a small rate on every attack. 

* Dragons and Titans can attack realm-wide improvements directly. Depending on the damage that they do, the Dragons and Titans will gain a portion of the lumber it cost to build those improvements. Dragon and Titan damage is approximately 7 times (at maximum) that of what you might lose on a regular attack. 

* There has been a 10% decrease in the amount of platinum one spy can carry. 

* Peace no longer blocks war. 

* Peace now also results in -10% landgains for both realms towards one another and reduces all invasion prestige to 0 against one another. 

Race Changes: 

* Halfling Defenders are now 0/2, and 75p less. 

* Wood Elf loses 5% population. 

* Orc Voodoo Magi now loses .75 defense to -1.5 maximum per 25% GN (down from -1 to max of -2). 

* Lycanthrope Ratman reduced 25p, 25r. 

* Firewalker Phoenix is now 0/4.5, up from 0/4. 

Honestly, I have almost no idea if the numbers for the Realm Improvements (the bonus numbers, the loss numbers, etc) are set in such a way that they are not broken one way or another. It's quite possible that the formulas for all realmwide improvements may change midround (once or more than once). Since we have no precedent for such a feature, balance before the round is pretty unknown.

-Ross

* Realm improvements will be able to be purchased with ore in addition to lumber. Dragons and Titans destroying improvements will still just gain lumber. 

* Instead of 1 point per 500 invested, it's going to be per 1000. I think 500 was too low a guesstimate based on some quick calculations. 

* 10 prestige will be generated for attack wins that would have netted more than 0 prestige. The defender will not lose this additional prestige, but the attacker will gain 10 extra. 

* Orcs now have a +30% lumber production bonus. 

* Registration packs of size 4 or more will randomize the races of the entire pack. The person creating the pack will only pick alignment based on the race they "choose" in registration, but the creator of the pack and every member joining that pack will have a random race of that alignment. Any group of size 3 or less will NOT be randomized.

-Ross

Because of the 4+ pack randomization, I have done further rebalancing of some of the races. This is in addition to earlier changes: 

Dwarf: 
Warrior to 7/2 
Pop bonus reduced to +7.5% 

Halfling 
Master Thief -75p 

Sylvan 
Centaur -100p 

Undead: 
-75% food consumption 

Spirit: 
-90% food consumption 

Dark Elf: 
Spirit Warrior is 6 and immortal hitting above 75%, not 80% 

Lycanthrope: 
Additional 5% population bonus 

Orc: 
Lose pop growth penalty 
Bone Breaker reduced 100p,10r

-Ross

Firewalker: 
Salamander -100p

-Ross

People seem to think maxing realm improvements is going to be too easy with the current setup, so again I'm doubling the amount of points it will take to add to realm improvements (to 2000). 

I expect to have the changes online sometime on Sunday. I want to let things run a few days with the changes to be sure everything is fine. Registration will probably open sometime around mid-week...maybe Wednesday or Thursday. When the changes go up I'll mail out the storyline race invitations. Registration begins once I have filled the 20 spots.

-Ross

# Round 19

Below are the changes for round 19. More may follow, but nothing is planned as of yet: 

* Round 18 strongest/largest ranks will be saved, and mid-round you will be presented with an option to pair your previous round's result up with your current account...this will set up your lifetime account, for rankings purposes. A new subsection of Valhalla will begin ranking players' lifetime accounts starting from Round 18. 

* Factories now reduce building cost by 3 * factories / total land % to 75%, down from 4 * % to 80% max. 

* Wizard Guilds will reduce spell cost by 2 * wizard guilds / total land % to a max of 40%, down from 2.5 * % to 50% max. 

* Forest Havens will now protect 4 * Havens / total land % of your population from fireballs. 

* Lightning bolt damage has been slightly reduced. 

* Players with low wizard and spy ratios will take somewhat less damage than last round. Last round's levels were simply too high. Low ratio players will still take more damage to make it worthwhile to keep your ratios halfway decent. 

* Banker's Foresight now gives +5% platinum production down from 10%. 

* Race Changes: 

* Human/Nomad Knight/Blademaster up 50p,15r to 1000p/100r 

* Halfling Staff Master and Master Thief each up 15r. 

* Firewalker Salamander reduced by 65r to 100r. 

* Kobold gain another +5% max population to +40%. 

* Goblin gain +5% attack strength against Humans/Nomads. 

* Firewalker gain +5% attack strength against Icekin. 

* Lycanthrope gain +5% attack strength against Wood Elf. 

* Icekin gain +5% attack strength against Gnomes. 

* Goblin Orc has been renamed to Hobgoblin. 

* New Race Added - Orcs 

Orcs 
Alignment: Evil 
Homes: Forest 
+20% Food consuption 
-20% Population Growth Rate 
Unaffected by Fear 

Savage 3/0, 300p0r 
Guard 0/3, 300p25r 
Voodoo Magi 0/5*, defensive power reduced by 1 for every 15% gryphon nests of attacker, max -2, 800p,0r 
Bone Breaker 7*/2, offensive power reduced by 1 for every 10% guard towers of defender, max -2, 1250p,125r 

Spell: Bloodrage - +10% Attack Strength but +20% Casualties (of the Orc player) 

* Dragons are being modified significantly. Lesser Dragon loses it's 10 offense and is reduced to 6, while platinum cost is reduced to 1000p. Landgains will work like normal landgains. Dragon's 1 week restriction has been trimmed to 2 days. The dragons are now less of an offensive threat, but power:cost wise they are still strong. They should require more skill to play now. 

* A new storyline race will be added in the first storyline events of the new round (Titans). This race will be identical to the Dragons in the form of units and abilities. However, Dragons will only be able to attack good aligned dominions (and vice versa), and Titans will only be able to attack evil aligned dominions (and vice versa). BOTH storyline races remain alignment neutral. 

* New wonder: Monument of Protection. Gives +5% defensive strength, and no one in the realm may attack or be attacked by Titans. 

* New wonder: Wizard Academy. All spell damage taken by controlling realm is reduced by half. 

As always, these changes are themselves subject to modification, may be removed before round 19 begins, or may be added to. 

Once again, I will randomly select from the top 50 premium accounts 20 players to play the storyline-based race accounts. These players will receive email invitations Monday or Tuesday. *IF* there are storyline based races next round the selection process will remain the same.

-Ross

Invitations to play a Dragon or Titan have been sent out to the randomly selected 20 premium account holders in the top 50 premium land finishers. 

If any offers are declined, or people fail to respond, another player using the same criteria will be sent an invitation. Last round there were several declines, so I expect to have to send a few more out if you were hoping to get one and didn't. There's still a chance.

-Ross

In addition to previously announced... 

* Kobold grunt to 200p from 225p. 
* Kobold Overlord cost to 850p from 950p. 
* Kobold Beast from 850p to 950p. 
* Kobold boats hold 40 troops instead of 30. 
* Orc Voodoo Magi reduces by 25% GN instead of 15%. 
* Lycanthrope Scavenger -25p to 300p. 
* Lizardfolk merfolk attack bonus reduced to 5% from 10%. 
* Icekin Ice Elemental 4* increases by .6 * WPA instead of .5 
* Icekin Archmage cost reduced 150p to 850p. 
* Goblin gem production +10% 
* Wood Elf Druid gets +1 offense and +1 defense for every 20% forests, down from 25% forests 
* Wood Elf Druid starts at 3/1, down from 3/3. 
* Dwarven Warrior now 7/1 with no special abilities. 

* Factories back to the way they were, but build cost function changed to be based on built land or total land / 2, whichever is greater. 

* Dragons/Titans: Will take 1/2 land gains instead of full or 1/5. 
* Dragons/Titans: Retaliation attacks from the same dragon hit on it's attacker inflicts 3/5 land gain instead of 1/2. 
* Dragons/Titans: Can attack the same target every 4 days instead of 2. 
* Dragons/Titans: Units die at 1/5 normal casualties on hits under 70%. 

Also, previously unmentioned on the General Discussion messageboard: 

* Dwarf -5% population now that Warrior is back to 7. 
* Orc Savage now 4/0, +25p.

-Ross


# Round 18

Lots of changes upcoming for next round. I think round 17 went pretty well, and things are getting shaken up again in round 18. There's a LOT of changes, and the reasoning behind some changes are due to other changes that might be later in the list. 

* You can no longer declare peace on a realm that is at war with you. 

* Race Changes: 

Halfling: Staff Master will now have -15% casualties instead of -25%. 

Merfolk: Siren is now 300p, instead of 275p. 

Gnome: Rockapult defense increases based on 20% mountains instead of 25% mountains. 

Firewalker: Salamander will now have -50% casualties instead of -25%. 

Dark Elf: Spirit Warrior will be 6 offense against dominion 80% of your size, instead of 85%. 

Wood Elf: Mystic price increased by 75p. 

Sylvan: Centaur price increased 100p. 

Spirit/Undead: Spectre/Vampire no longer get +1 offense against Humans/Nomads. 

* Prestige: You can no longer have more prestige than you have land size. 

* Guards: Leaving the Elite Guard will now place you back into the Royal Guard. 

* Attacking Wonders: If you are currently applying to the Royal Guard when you attack a wonder, your application is reset. 

* Players with extremely low spy and magic ratios will take significantly more damage from spy and magic operations (respectively). 

* All third and fourth military units of all races were increased approximately 10% (any race changes above occured before this increase in addition to this increase). 

* The 2:1 attacking rule will now enforce that it is met after attacks are sent out. This means that if you attempt to send out units that would cause your at-home ratio to exceed 2:1 modified offense: modified defense, you will not be able to send out those units. The post-attack ratio must be 2:1 or less. 

* The premium search page will now let you select any races in combination that you would like to search for. Previously you could select "All Good", "All Evil", "All", or one specific race. Now, you can also select multiple races instead of just one (or still just one, if you are so inclined).

-Ross

Part 2...even more changes. 

* Building rebalance (credit Sir G for extensive building breakdown): 

Forest Haven: Retains current functions and also reduces spy cost by 3 * Havens / Total Land % to a 60% maximum. 

Treasury: Now increases platinum income by 1% to 30% maximum. Also protects 3% of your platinum from being stolen to 75% maximum. 

Wizard Guild: Retains current functions and also reduces spell costs by 2.5 * Wizard Guilds / Total Land % to 50% maximum. 

Shrine: Reduces casualties by 4 * Shrines / Total Land % to 80% maximum. 

Tower: Produces 25 mana. 

Temple: Reduces defensive mods of target by 1.25 * Temples / Total Land % to a maximum reduction of 0 mods. Increases population growth rate by 2.5 * Temples / Total Land % to no maximum. 

Factory: Reduces build cost by 4 * Factories / Total Land % to 80% maximum. Reduces rezoning cost by 4 * Factories / Total Land % to 80% maximum. 

Guard Tower: Increases defensive power by 1.5 * Guard Towers / Total Land % to 60% maximum. 

Gryphon Nest: Increases offensive power by 1.5 * Gryphon Nests / Total Land % to 60% maximum. 

Diamond Mine: Produces 15 gems. 

Ore Mine: Produces 60 ore. 

Lumberyard: Produces 50 lumber. 

Masonry: Now has no maximum cap. 

Smithy: Reduces unit costs by Smithies / Total Land % to 60% maximum. 

* Improvements: All improvements have been given higher maximums. Science, Forges and Walls have increased from 10% maximum to 20% maximum. Irrigation and Towers have increased from 30% to 60% maximum. Keep has increased from 20% maximum to 30% maximum. HOWEVER, it is now increasingly more difficult to obtain these bonuses. In previous rounds it has been very easy to obtain near maximums in improvement bonuses with little effort. It's now harder, but the reward can be much greater. 

* Out of Protection: Not a definite change, but I am strongly considering automatically removing land from under-defended dominions (those not meeting land defense) and replacing the taken land with defensive troops. 

* Lifetime Records: Beginning at the end of round 18, I will start keeping records that track player's dominions over the course of their playing lifetime, and keep rankings of players who have accumulated the most land and networth over future rounds. I will only tally player records who FINISH ROUNDS, so quitting early means your overall Dominion ranking won't increase if you do not finish the round. 

* Tech Tree: This is currently being revamped, but will not completed before round 18 begins. 

* Dragons: Yes, the dragons have returned, but in different form than before. Credit Atilas for the Dragon Fear concept. 

-In round 18 there will be 20 dragons in Realm #1. These 20 dragons have been selected from a pool of the top 50 land finishers among PREMIUM accounts only (not the top 20...just 20 from the top 50). These 20 players will be getting e-mails most likely on Sunday evening (EST) inviting them to play dragons and will have 48 hours to accept. Should any turn the option down or not respond within that 48 hour time frame, another player from the aforementioned pool will be selected. 

-In future rounds there will most likely be dragon or other storyline based race(s) in realm 1, and these too will be selected from a group of premium accounts from the prior round only. Before the start of round 18 I will specifically state by which criteria those 20 accounts will be accepted, as it *may* vary round to round. 

-No player other than Dragons will be in realm 1, and it is not possible to defect into the realm. 

-Homes on Plains. 

-Neutral alignment. 

-Cannot be demoralized. 

-No unique spell. 

-Cannot attack wonders. 

Wyrm: 4/0, 300p, no boats needed 
Drake: 0/4, 300p 
Wyvern: 4/6, no boats needed, only dies to High Cleric's Tower or on razes, 1000p 
Lesser Dragon: 10/2, no boats needed, only dies to High Cleric's Tower or on razes, 1400p 

-Obviously this is the strongest race is the game militarily, however if you keep reading you will see how this will be kept under check. 

-Dragons do not gain or lose prestige. 

-The realm holding the Dragon's Lair cannot attack the Dragons, and vice versa. 

-Dragons do not capture land as normal. They simply exert their "influence" over existing player's lands and surrounding territories. They gain land like normal, in normal amounts, but defenders only lose 1/5 of the land they would normally lose to such an attack. This means the game will artificially create 4/5 of the land the dragon's gain (representative of "influence"). 

-Dragons will only cause 1/5 of the casualties of other races. 

-Dragons will be unable to delete, defect, enter away mode or restart. 

-Players who use a Dragon account will be limited to only that account and still be bound by all the rules and regulations of the game. If any player using a Dragon account is found to be breaking a rule then the account will be taken away from them. 

-All Dragons may only attack the same player once per week, unless attacked by that dominion, and then only that dragon may retaliate. This means if Dragon 1 hits Player A, NO DRAGON may hit Player A again for a week. However, if Player A retaliates against the dragons and attacks Dragon B, then Dragon B may attack Player A within 24 hours, regardless of whether the week is up. 

-Dragon Fear: Dragon Fear, for every player, begins at 0 and can never drop below 0. This number is displayed on your status screen. If a Dragon successfully invades a dominion, that entire realm's dragon fear is increased by the amount of land/influence gained by the Dragon. If a dominion successfully invades a dragon, the entire realm's dragon fear is reduced by 1.5 * the amount of land gained by the dominion. Dragon Fear drives down food production by 2 * Fear / Total Land %, and maximum population by 2 * Fear / Total Land %. 

-Apocalypse Stone: This wonder returns from round 7. It's function is now that no dominion in the realm is affected by dragon fear. 


* And that's it. For now. Stay tuned to the annoucements for potential other changes, or modifications of these changes. The scribes won't be changed for a couple days.

-Ross

* Players who accept the position of dragons will be ineligible to play whatever storyline-based race is in realm 1 the following round. 

* Treasury Clarification: Does not protect your resources as originally stated (in a manner of speaking), but rather reduces the amount stolen by the percentage indicated. 

* Dragons are not in the strongest/largest rankings. 

* Dominions do not gain dragon fear during protection. 

* Farms will now produce 60 bushels. 

* Barracks are moved to Hills, and will hold 38 trained or training military units instead of 40. They are still NOT affected by population bonuses.

-Ross

The scribes should now be updated. 

Also, some changes: 

* Gnomes can now build barracks. 

* Maximum effects of dragon fear are now -10% (population and food). 

* Dragons cannot join the Elite Guard (but can join the Royal Guard). 

* Icekin Frostmage now depends on 20% mountains instead of 25%. 

-Ross

Gnomes will not get the change announced in the previous message. They still can no longer build barracks. I had forgotten they got a boost from increased ore mine production.

-Ross

Pretty minor: Dragons can now restart, but they can't change their dominion name, ruler name, or race (for obvious reasons).

-Ross

Dragon change + future:

* Like when they were first in the game, dragons will suffer reduced damage from spells and spy operations. 

* Next round, 20 dragons and/or other storyline-based race(s) will be selected from the top 50 premium account finishers, with ranking based on land descending. 20 players will be randomly selected from the pool of 50, however Kamikaze Games reserves the right to pass over any player selected if there is ANY suspicion of ANY rule infraction during the course of the round.

-Ross

* Any player using a Dragon account this round will be in-eligible for a storyline based race next round.

-Ross


# Round 17

Split into 2 posts, because it can't even fit into 1. 

Below is the preliminary list of changes for the coming round. Any and/or all of this may change as I deem necessary. This is probably the biggest set of changes ever, since the game has begun. I hope I remembered everything...there's quite a bit. 

* First, the player challenge from last round to increase active players from 8000 to 10000 was not reached. The playerbase wound up around 9000 people. The same challenge is being re-issued for this round. If we can get to 10,000 active players, I will add heros to the entire playerbase. 

* Food aid within realm has been removed. 

* The National Bank now offers food for trade. You can get 1 bushel for every 1 gem, or 1 bushel for every 4 platinum, lumber or ore. This is obviously a very bad deal for you and a very good deal for the bank. Relying on the bank for food is really only for times of extreme need. 

* The 2.5:1 rule has been changed to the 2:1 rule. You must now build 1 modified defense for every 2 modified offense, minimum, in order to be able to even attack. 

* Land captured from invading another dominion can now be built on for 75% of the normal cost. Explored land construction cost remains the same. 

* Destruction of guard towers can no longer be done on the destruction page. Instead, guard towers are now being treated like military releasing, and will be destroyed on the military release page. This destruction will count towards the 15% of defense you are allowed to destroy at one time. 

* The rankings will now feature several new pages. There will be ranks for the largest and strongest Evil and Good aligned dominions, and the largest and strongest Monarchs. A new rankings has also been created for the winningest Dominions. The winningest Dominion ranking will only be updated every 2 days, rather than the usual 6 hours, so as not to reveal when people have attacked. There may or may not be a ranking for platinum stealing added as well (greatest thieves). That is still to be determined. 

* The attack gains formula has changed. Hitting dominions smaller than 75% of your size has had gains reduction. The further you get from 75% the larger the reduction. Hitting at 50% of your size will now give you HALF the gains it would have given you in round 16. It will become very unprofitable to hit lower than the royal guard range of 66%. 

* Attacking Wins (of 75% or higher out-of-realm) and Losses totals have been added to everyone's Statistics Advisor. Previously this was a Premium only feature. This is the win total that will be reflected in the winningest dominion ranking. 

* Attacks deemed a raze (any attack failing by 20% or more) will result in 60% less defensive casualties than normal. 

* PREMIUM STUFF: 
-The odds of getting a hero on successful 75% attack has been increased from 15% to 25%. 
-Hero rankings now reflect whether a hero is alive or dead. 
-Premium accounts have the ability to restart (via Account Options link) in whatever protection wave they wish (waves 1 to 6). This is obviously only available if your premium access is granted before the round begins. The later you wait to sign up for premium access, the greater the odds your access will not be set up by the time the round begins. 
-Production amounts are now tracked throughout the game. Your statistics advisor will keep a running tally of the resources you produce. 

* RACE CHANGES: 
-Goblin Orcs now plunder only when the target is of 75% your land size or higher. 
-Troll Basher and Smasher lose the +1 bonus against halflings. 
-Merfolk lose the +10% food production bonus. 
-Sylvan Dryad increased by 50p, Centaur by 100p, 15r. 
-Lycanthrope and Undead/Spirit conversions are taxed in-realm, just like plunder amounts and land. 
-Lizardfolk lose attack bonus against Halfling. 
-Lizardfolk gain +10% attack bonus against Merfolk. 
-Lizardfolk lose population penalty. 
-Icekin food consumption increased to -50% bonus from -30% bonus. 
-Firewalker Salamander gains 3 defense, up from 2. 
-Firewalker gets +5% population. 

* Major new changes are below. Going kind of in a time warp, a lot of the below changes are things that have been done in the past or considered in the past, or posted on the suggestions board eons ago. One of the below changes is from a post dating back to October of 2000. That is not a typo. I saved the thread and always knew it would be in the game someday. Anyways, without further ado: 

* New buildings: 
-Spy Guilds have been changed into Forest Havens. Each forest haven provides 20 peasants with .5 defense each. In other terms, each haven provides 10 defense if you have 20 peasants available for it to use. Havens also reduce spy losses on failed operations by 3 * (% havens / total land size) to a maximum bonus of 60%. 
-Hospitals: Built on Hills. Hospitals reduce defensive casualties by 2 * (% hospitals / total land size) to a maximum bonus of 60%. Hospitals also increase population growth rate by (% hospitals / total land size). 
-Barracks: Built on Mountains. Barracks can house 40 troops. Unlike homes, which can house 30 peasants or military units, barracks can only house military units. 
-Temples: Built on Swamps. Reduces offensive casualties by 3 * (% temples / total land size) to a maximum bonus of 60%. 
-Treasuries: Built on Caverns. Increases income by .75% * (% treasuries / total land size) 

* Modified old buildings: 
-Factory rezoning bonus bumped up to 3x to a max of 60% from 2x and a max of 40%. 
-Smithy bonus of 2x has been reduced to 1.2x. This is a major difference. Currently, 20% smithies give 40% reduced military costs, and most everybody runs this amount. The maximum of 40% remains the same, but it would now require 33.3% smithies (a full third of your land) to achieve a 40% bonus. This should force people into using base units for at least the initial part of the round. It will slow the offensive growth potential, as well as the rise in OP and necessary DP to defend that OP. 
-Guard Towers bonus has been reduced from 2x to 1x, with the same maximum. Guard Towers, quite simply, were too powerful. See Nest change for more information. 
-Gryphon Nests bonus has been reduced from 2x to 1x, with the same maximum. Ditto guard towers. Nests and guard towers should be a supplementary bonus, but a majority of people run at least 20% of one or the other, driving up OP and DP levels by 40%. Now, the reduced bonus will lower these values and actually make people think before using them. 

* Storyline: The storyline is making a glorious return. It is not returning in all it's 'individualized race story' glory, but rather in the form of good vs. evil. There will be one story for evil dominions, and one for good dominions. Bonuses will be given based on alignment, rather than by race. 

* Alignments: In line with the return of the storyline, realms will return to their previous segregation of good and evil. 

-Ross

* Prestige: Designed long ago, prestige has been modified from it's old form (from those who even remember it). Every player will start with 250 prestige. For every 250 points of prestige, dominions will receive +1% attack strength, +1% maximum population, and +1% food production. Prestige can be gained and lost, and can be negative. Negative prestige will cause dominions to LOSE strength, maximum population, and food production rather than gain. Players gain prestige for attacking and defeating dominions between 75% and 120% of their land size. Dominions will lose prestige for attacking dominions under 2/3 of their land size, and for razing another dominion (failing an attack by 20% or more). Invading a dominion that has been hit multiple times recently will also result in either a smaller gain in prestige or a negative gain in prestige, depending on how many times it has been hit. Any positive prestige gain is won when your troops return, and deducted from the target dominion's prestige total. A new ranking has also been added...as if you couldn't guess...Most Prestigious Dominions. 

* Wars: The war system has been significantly altered to make wars more appealing and increase realm cooperation. Firstly, wars now have a minimum timeframe of 48 hours, down from 72. The 5% war benefit, as well as use of several spells and spy operations, were previously restricted to realms in which YOUR REALM had declared on. Now, all spells and spy operations, as well as the war bonus, is given to you against any realm that has declared war on you, or any realm you have declared war on. You do not need to declare war back in order to receive these bonuses. Any realm that you are at war with will result in 15% more prestige gains for invasion. Mutual war declarations now have added functions. Previously, mutual war declarations gave both sides +10% attacking power. Now, mutual war will give 25% more prestige to attacks (up from 15% one way declaration), increase land gains by 10%, and enable both spy operations and spells to gain small amounts of prestige as well. 

* Tech Tree: A tech tree has been added to the game. Your dominion will now be able to research new advances for every time you obtain 750 built acres (at 750 built land, 1500, 2250, etc). Some combinations of advances will allow for other advances previously unavailable to you. Advancement is done from the Improvements page. Technological Advances are listed below. 

BATTLE COMMANDER 
*Commander's Insight: -5% offensive casualties 
*Tactician: -5% defensive casualties 
~Insight and Tactician allow: Military Genius: +5% attack power 

EXPLORER 
*Caravan Leader: -5% exploring platinum cost 
*Explorer's Intuition: -1 draftee per acre explore cost (minimum 3) 
~Caravan Leader and Intuition allow: Explorer's Luck: -10% exploring platinum cost 

SPY 
*Slight of Hand: +5% success rate on Spy Operations 
*Darkness Walker: -5% spy losses on failed operations 
~Slight of Hand and Darkness Walker allow: Spy Master: +10% success rate, -10% losses 

WIZARD 
*Magician's Apprentice: +10% success rate on spells 
*Magician's Awe: +10% wizard strength 
~Apprentice and Awe allow: Master of Magi: +15% success rate of spells, +5% effectiveness of all self spells 

PRODUCER 
*Farmer's Growth: +10% food production 
*Miner's Refining: +5% gem production 
~Farmer's Growth and Miner's Refining allow: Banker's Foresight: +10% platinum production 

BUILDER 
*Mason's Art: -10% construction platinum costs 
*Forester's Touch: +10% lumber production 
~Mason's Art and Forester's Touch allow: Urban Planner: +2% population maximum 


~Military Genius and Explorer's Luck allow: Conqueror's Will: +10% attack power, -15% exploring platinum cost 
~Spy Master and Master of Magi allow: Dark Artistry: +15% effectiveness of all self spells, +15% success rate of spy operations 
~Banker's Foresight and Urban Planner allow: Urban Mastery: +5% population maximum 

-Ross

And, finally, another set of changes: 

* Maximum Treasury bonus is 30% 

* New Spell, Vision: Reveals tecnological advancements of target Dominion. 

* Barracks clarification: Barracks do not house peasants. Barracks do not house draftees. Barracks always only hold 40 trained or training military units, regardless of population bonuses. 

* Casualty clarification: All bonuses except for race specific unit bonuses are applied to a unit first, capped at 60%. Even if you have 90% casualty reduction bonuses somehow, only 60% will be applied. Then, to that number, any unit bonus is applied, such as the regeneration ability for Trolls. Suicide squads remain at 50% casualties regardless of any casualty bonuses (if you send 100, 50 will die). 

* There is now a rankings page for just about everything imaginable. Want to become a master of fire? No problem. Hurl some fireballs and check the rankings. Want to know if you are the most prestigious spy in the game? No problem, check the rankings. Want to know if you are the most successful saboteur (boat sinkings)? Again, check the rankings. Most victorious on the battlefield? Most prestigious? Greatest thief? Check the ranks, check the ranks, check the ranks. Largest Evil Dominion? Strongest Monarch? Check the rankings. Check the rankings. And another ton of rankings not listed, but you get the idea. If you'd prefer to play a Spy/Thief/Mage/Attacker, go for it. You've got the tech tree abilities now in addition to the massively extended rankings. Now you can set 100 different objectives for the round, rather than just compete to be the strongest or largest. 

* Orc plunder is now capped at necessary orcs needed to defeat a target, subtracted by the other military power you may have sent. So if you sent 1000 orcs along with 1000 wolf riders, and the wolf riders had enough power to defeat your enemy, your orcs plunder nothing. If it would have taken 1000 wolf riders and 500 orcs to win the battle, only 500 orcs would plunder, and the other 500 would return nothing. Orc plunder has also been reduced slightly, to maximums of 20% from 30%, and platinum to 50p from 60p, gems to 10 from 12. 

* Hospitals and Temples have changed. Hospitals are now known as Shrines. Shrines reduce offensive combat losses by 2 * (Shrines / Total Land)% to a maximum of 60%. Temples have two functions. First, they increase population growth rate by (Temples / Total Land)%. Second, they reduce defensive bonus modifiers by .75 * (Temples / Total Land)%. This means if a target dominion has ANY defensive modifiers, be it spells, wonders, guard towers, race bonuses, etc, Temples can reduce that bonus as low as 0, but never below 0. 

* Most wonders giving offensive and defensive bonuses have had bonus reduction. The Obelisk is now 5%/5% instead of 10%/10%. Both Temples are now 10% from 15%. The Lair is now 10%/5% from 15%/10%. 

* Race changes (mostly cost increases): 

-Gnomes and Dark Elves are unable to build shrines. Sorry, blame Sarmis, it was his idea. 
-Sylvan unit price changes of the last announcement were removed. They are back the way they were. 
-Snow Witch has a price increase of 25p. 
-Shaman has a price increase of 25p. 
-Miner has a price increase of 25p. 
-Garou has a price increase of 100p. 
-Overlord has a price increase of 50p. 
-Ratman has a price increase of 50p. 
-Scavenger has a price increase of 50p. 
-Gargoyle has a price increase of 25p. 
-Suicide Squad has a price increase of 20p. 
-Rockapult has a price increase of 100p. 
-Master Thieves have a price reduction of 100p. 

* Note on above price increases: Most of those units are base units, and I expect base units to be used more initially in the game. Most were much cheaper than they should have been to encourage players to use them before. Now, most players will probably OPT to take these units first, so that encouragement (ie. prices that were far too low) need not remain. A number of those units cost less than 300p, and early game they definitely needed to be more in line with the other base units of other races.

-Ross

Science bonus is now capped at 10%, like Forges and Walls. 

There is now a maximum platinum production bonus of 50% (without prestige). Any higher bonus than 50% is reduced to 50%. So if you have, for some reason 80% in platinum income bonuses, that bonus is reduced to 50%.

-Ross

Further changes 3 missing info


# Round 16

RACE CHANGES 
------------ 
Mixing things up a bit for the races, so here we go: 

* Lycanthrope get +5% attack bonus against Humans/Nomads. 

* Spirit/Undead Vampire/Spectre bonus against Trolls has been changed to Humans/Nomads. (Poor humans, that's two in a row...) 

* Dark Elf Adept is now 1/5 wizard on offense instead of 1/10. 

* Sylvan Dryad is now 1/5 wizard on offense instead of 1/10. 

* Dark Elf get +5% attack strength against Halflings. 

* Merfolk get +5% attack strength against Lizardfolk. 

* A new race has been added: 

Firewalkers 
Alignment: Good 
Homes: Caverns 
Spell: Alchemist Flame - Increases alchemy production by 20 platinum. 
Bonuses/Penalties - Food Consumption +10%, Lumber Production -10%, Gem Production +10% 

Fire Sprite: 3/0, 300p, 0r 
Flamewolf: 0/3, 300p, 0r 
Phoenix: 0/4, 850p, 0r cannot be killed except by Icekin 
Salamander: 5/2, 1000p, 150r, 25% less casualties when attacking 


OTHER CHANGES 
------------- 

* You can no longer steal any resource from any dominion of smaller land size than you. People have complained about people resource farming and called for me to remove stealing altogether. That is simply never going to happen. I think this will address concerns just fine. 

* The 3:1 attacking rule has been changed to 2.5:1 and is now based off of modified offense:modified defense rather than raw values. 

* When destroyed, wonder hit points will be affected by how much damage the realm that destroyed it managed to do to the wonder. Realms that do little damage to a wonder but destroy it will have significantly weaker wonders. 


PREMIUM ADDITION 
---------------- 
Players who sign up for premium access in round 16 will get to help test a new feature: Heros. In order not to give these players an unfair advantage, the heros are a roleplaying element for the purposes of this test, and do not impact gameplay in any way. I had originally intended this as a feature of a pay-2-play Dominion game, but I figured I might as well make some use of it in the meantime. 

Heros can be gained by attacking (successfully) dominions of size at least 75% as large as yourself (land size, out of realm). A dominion can have multiple heros at one time. Heros have a name and can lead your attacks, thereby accumulating stats (wins/losses) by which they can be ranked (anonymously by hero name, so nobody knows who any hero belongs to). Heros can die, however, and will do so at a higher rate for failed attacks than successful attacks. 


PLAYER CHALLENGE 
---------------- 
This round we had about 8,000 active players. If we can end the next round with 10,000 active players (and believe me, I will be counting very strictly when it comes to people I think might create multiple accounts to increase this total come end game), I will consider moving heros as a feature to the entire playerbase, complete with actual gameplay impact (more than just roleplaying, they will give you bonuses on offense and defense, or something similar). This means spreading the word to friends and acquaintances from other games in an effort to boost the playerbase. Plus, you can use your referral links and get land by doing so. 

Personally, I'd also like to see more support from the playerbase in terms of paying attention to the ads we serve and supporting this site by visiting some of our sponsors. The banners are important, and they keep this site running.

-Ross

I had forgotten that I'd given the Trolls against Humans/Nomads last round that was somewhat balanced against the Spirit/Undead bonus against Trolls. Now that the Spirit/Undead bonus is against Humans, the Trolls will lose their bonus against Humans/Nomads.

-Ross

* The wonder system has been tweaked from the earlier announcement to use Sir G's suggestion from the messageboard. Wonders now have a minimum power equal to 1/5 the current maximum power of a wonder, and realms will get that power if 2 times the damage they do to the wonder does not equal the minimum...otherwise they will get twice the damage in hitpoints, assuming it is less than the current maximum, in which case they will get the current maximum. 

* No dominion will be allowed to steal resources until the 5th day of the round to prevent out of protection farming.

-Ross


# Round 15

* The Stay In Realm option is now available, as posted in the previous announcement. 

* Gnome and Wood Elf units that gain and lose power (and thus networth) by land percentages now have a flat, fixed networth for those units. 

* Monarchs must have 3/5 of the votes cast in a realm in order to be elected. Votes cast that change the totals to under 3/5 will result in no monarch. 

* Wonders will obtain hit points by day of the round when they are destroyed, rather than by networth of the realm that destroys it. Hit points will increase in a linear function to 2 million, the most hit points a wonder can have at one time. 

* Previously, players were forced to leave a minimum of 25% of their defense at home. This amount has been raised to 33%. 

* Some spells and spy operations are now being limited. Sabotage boats, fireball, lightning bolt, demoralize, disband spies, assassinate wizards and magic snare can now only be used on either dominions with whom your realm is at war with, or dominions that have attacked you in the past 24 hours. This means you can perform those operations/spells ONLY on dominions in a realm you have declared war on or on dominions that have attacked you (successfully or not) within 24 hours of your attempted operation/spell. 

* Undead/Spirit units are no longer immortal against Wonders. 

* Dark Elf Spirit warriors are no longer immortal against Wonders. 

* Dark Elves get +5% gem production. 

* Merfolk will have -20% lumber production increased to -30%. 

* Icekin will gain +5% platinum production. 

* Lycanthrope Werewolf will be 50p cheaper. 

* Troll Smasher and Basher will also get increased power on both Humans and Wood Elves, giving them a total of 6 races with which those units are more powerful.

-Ross

* Spirits/Undead Spectre/Vampire will have an offensive power of 5 (up from 4) against Trolls.

-Ross


# Misc

The first change for next round is already online, and you will see it when you log in. You now have the option to stay with your current realmmates. This option may or may not be available every round, depending on whether I think the realms need to be re-mixed. But, at least for this next round, players have the option to remain with their current realmmates who select the same option.

-Ross


# Round 14

Below are the changes for Round 14. There's almost no race changes due to the diversity of races in the top 100. This is easily the most diverse results of any round. 

* The entire war/wonder system has been revamped. 

* War size restrictions have been removed. 

* War bonus is now 5% when you declare war on another realm, unless the other realm is also at war with you. In case of mutual war declarations, both realms receive a 10% attack bonus. 

* Wonders begin with 250,000 hit points in Realm 0, instead of a million. 

* Wonders can no longer be built. 

* Wonders now will be automatically 'built' by the realm that destroys the wonder. This means the last hit of the dominion that that takes it down is considered the realm that destroys it. It gets rebuilt in this dominion's realm immediately. 

* Wonder Hit Points overall have been lowered. 

* Wonders may only be attacked by realms that have declared war. If you want to attack a wonder in a given realm you must declare war on that realm. The only exception to this is Realm 0. 

* Any wonder that is destroyed by a realm that already owns a wonder will be rebuilt in realm 0. 

* The maximum amount you can explore at one time has been reduced from 3 * Land Size to Land Size. This means the most you can be exploring at one time is at most the amount of land you currently own. 

* The Search function (for premium accounts) now allows specification of Dominions In Protection, Out of Protection, and All. 

* Premium Accounts also now have an Attacking Wins and Attacking Losses counter listed on their Statistics Advisor for Wins and Losses outside of the Realm (intra-realm attacks do not count). 

* There is now an anti-land farming capability built into the game. While not perfect, it should help automatically detect and remove land gained through landfarming. 

* There will be a new referral system for encouraging new players to join the game. AFTER the first day of the round, everyone will have a referral link they can provide to others. For each referral you get that reaches 1250 acres, you will be given 35 land. A maximum of 5 bonuses will be paid out in a given round (175 possible land). 

* Troll Bashers will be raised in price by 100p.

-Ross

Due to popular request, the evil and good races are going to be mixed again within the realms.

-Ross

* The Premium search option now allows you to search by guard status (all dominions, no guards, royal guard, elite guard). 

* After testing the anti-farming fix, several parameters have been modified to make the automation work better.

# Round 11

Below are the list of changes I'm planning for Round 11. As usual, there may be addendums or modifications to these changes. Keep your eyes on the announcements. 


* Guard Tower/Gryphon Nest change: These buildings will now be 1.5 * (building %) to a max of 30%. This devalues the bonuses of these buildings by 25%. Hopefully this change might lower the amount of people building the max on these buildings. 

* Spy Guild change: This building will now give a bonus of 3 * (building %) to a max of 60%, instead of 2 * (building %). This change increases by value of the bonus by 50%, making Spy Guilds more useful. 

* Platinum Stealing: In tandem with the above upgrade to the Spy Guilds, the base steal amount of platinum has been reduced by 20%. This makes the Spy Guilds more valuable and dampens slightly current steal amounts. 

* New Spell: 
Energy Mirror: 20% chance to repel successful offensive spells back at caster. 

* Race Changes: 

Merfolk: Leviathan +30p to 1350p 

Sylvan: Satyr to 3 offense, +50p to 275p 

Kobold: Beast +50p to 750p 

Goblin: Additional 5% population bonus 

Spirit/Undead: 
Vampire/Spectre change- 
On successful attacks of targets less than 50% of your land size, no units will be converted. 
On successful attacks between 50% and 70% of your land size, Vampires/Spectres will convert like Progeny/Ghosts, into the two base units. 
On successful attacks of targets 70% or higher of your land size, Vampires/Spectres convert as they do now into Progeny/Ghosts.

-Ross

Based on the feedback I have received from the first set of changes, the following changes will be made: 

* Guard Towers / Gryphon Nests: These buildings will be restored to their previous function. 

* Castle Improvements: To compensate for the change back of Guard Towers and Gryphon Nests, the new maximum (without Masonries) for Walls and Forges is 10%. The other improvements will remain with a 20% maximum (without Masonries). 

* Docks will now also prevent 2 boats per dock from being sunk. Thus, if you have 10 docks, 20 boats you have cannot be sunk. Running a higher percentage of docks will allow you to have a fair amount of protection against boat sinkings. 

* Rezoning costs will be slightly reduced. If you want anything cheaper, build factories. :)

# Round 10?

Base changes missing.

Changes from my last announcement. 

Registration will NOT open this weekend due to further technical problems. It will not be possible to open registration until Monday, at the earliest. I'm not happy about it either. 

Secondly, I'm also going to lower the Undead/Spirit defensive bonus back to 5%.

-Ross


# Round 9

Not too much. For the race changes, if a race isn't listed it received no changes. 

* Spy losses reduced 20% 

* Monarchy bonus reduced from 10% plat to 5% 

* Landgain reduction for bottomfeeding (hitting players much smaller than yourself) 

* Attacking inactives yields higher land, but with higher tax (changed mid-round 8) 

* No stealing from in-realm (changed mid-round 8) 

* Sylvan: -50p Centaur 

* Troll: -45p Basher, Brute to 4/0 but cost increase to 350p 

* Lycanthrope: -100p Garou (personally I think this is a huge mistake but maybe it'll entice people to play Lycanthrope) 

* Kobold: Underling downgraded to 2 defense 

* Dark Elf: Adept only 1/4 Wizard on offense (to help prevent abuse), but remains 1/2 Wizard on defense 

* Merfolk: -25p Kraken 

* Lizardfolk: -50p Lizardmen

-Ross

Round 9 registration is open. The round starts Tuesday. 

One change: Sylvan Dryad is now 1/4 wizard for offensive spells, the same as the Dark Elf Adept.

# Round 8

# Round 7

Here is a preliminary list of changes for the upcoming round. Note that there will be 3 new races not listed in the below changes (Lizardmen, Planewalker, Dragon (Dragon being non-selectable by players)) that will be detailed at a later date. All the below changes are not final and subject to debate. 

The changes: 

* Continuation of storyline. Details to be withheld until the round ends. It will involve the Dragons of Realm 0. 

* The Monarch's population bonus will be removed. 

* Espionage and Magic operations against realms without a war declaration will do slightly more damage than they have been (but still not as much as those at war). 

* The networth formula was significantly better this round but still not 100% reflective, and will be changed slightly. 

* A surprise or two to come. :) 


Race Changes: 

* Halfling: Master Thief raised in price 100p (Halflings 19(!) of the top 100 land). 

* Troll: Smasher's will lose their defensive bonus against the smaller races (but retain the offensive bonus). 

* Human/Nomad: Knights/Blademasters increased to 80r from 60r. 

* Merfolk: Lizardman unit replaced by Mermen as base offensive unit. Base defensive unit will be Sirens. Mermen and Sirens will be reduced in cost 25p. 

* Goblin: Shamans will now decrease combat losses more effectively. 

* Dwarf: Clerics will now decrease combat losses more effectively. 

* Lycanthrope: Gain +5% population bonus. I'm hoping this should be just the right boost for them. 

* Gnome: 5% population penalty will be reduced to 2.5%. Gem production will increase from +5% to +10%. 

* Undead/Spirit: Wraiths will be renamed to Progeny (see dictionary.com if you don't understand). Land-ratio based conversions will be reflected more accurately (previously conversions were based loosely on land ratio, and will now be closer). Vampires/Spectres will now convert to Progeny/Ghosts instead of Vampires/Spectres. I had considered a 2/5 Progeny/Ghost change in addition to a 3/3 change in Vampires/Spectres as well...but think conversion to Progeny/Ghosts should make the race less abusable. 

* Dark Elf/Wood Elf/Kobold: None.

-Ross

Lycanthrope Garou's will change to 6/0 from 6/1, thus not dying (and not participating) in defense.

-Ross

These are likely changes to what has been previously posted: 

* Wonders will be able to be built straight out of protection, but the minimum cost has been increased significantly. 

* Dragons will likely suffer significantly less damage from spy/magic operations due to the fact that I forsee massive, massive amounts of ops on them. It'll add up. 

* Lizardmen will be reduced in cost by 100p. 

* Planewalker's will probably have 6/0 and 0/6 Elementals and Golems. The Conjurers and Summoners will remain 0/1, but will be worth 1/3 of a Wizard instead of a 1/5 of a Wizard. Instead of a 2:1 cap, Summoners and Conjurers will have a 3:1 cap with their respectively summoned units.
