## Post-Round 4?

Last round, armies of evil combined forces to attack and reclaim lands that were once theirs. They swept through many lands before a common defense could be mounted. Hordes of evil troops marched into battle at the Human city of Brimstone Keep, where the Alliance of Humans, Dwarves, Wood Elves, Hobbits, Gnomes and Merfolk stood to oppose them. Forces from both sides were decimated. The Evil Order, organized by the Dark Elves, and also composed of Goblins, Trolls, Undead and Lycanthropes were finally forced to retreat and re-group after having rampaged and pillaged city after city.

The battle is far from over. The Order has begun to swiftly rebuild their forces, and have enlisted the aid of the Kobolds to help in their cause. What will happen this round?

## Post-Round 14

It has been a great many years since these lands were ravaged by the Dragon horde. The dragons have come and gone, taking with them the mystical Planewalkers that roamed these lands as well. But other races have risen up and grown in power since the time of the Dragon's awakening. The forests run wild with the growth of the Sylvans. The oceans fill with the vast armies of Lizardfolk. From the frosted mountain peaks emerged the magical powers of the Icekin, and from cavernous depths arose the Firewalkers.

Around the lands, these and other races strive for power, battling one another for territory and strength. What will happen this round? Will Goblin hordes rampage through the lands? Or will the Humans crusade over the lands ruled by the Undead? Will another force rise out of the ashes to dominate the lands? Create a Dominion now, and add your forces to the battle.
