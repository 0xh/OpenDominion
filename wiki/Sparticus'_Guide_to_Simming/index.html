<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Introduction"> Introduction </span></h2>
<p>Do not underestimate the importance of protection. In its infancy your dominion is weak, undeveloped, and in a state of disarray. You must nurture her so she can be big and strong when she comes out of the womb to face the harsh and cruel world of Kamikazia. The choices you make during this stage of the game will have lasting consequences, and can be the difference between a solid finish and a slow painful round.
</p><p>I will admit that I am not the best simmer in the game. The distinction between a good simmer and a great simmer is a subtle one, and there are some complex intricacies that I have yet to master. However, I consider myself to be well above average in terms of skill, and my results are not too far behind those of "sim gods" like Ladeda.
</p><p>Furthermore, this guide is not the be-all and end-all of simming. Perfecting sims requires tweaking, which will not be the focus of this guide. I will provide a foundation for you to build upon. I'm not going to give you a rigid set of rules to abide by so you can mindlessly replicate cookie cutter sims. I'm going to lay out basic strategies and explain the reasoning behind them. If you fancy yourself an average or below average simmer, then I can pretty much guarantee that you will notice immediate improvement in your sims upon completion of this guide.
</p><p>One last note: this guide is long. The first few sims you make with this guide may be time consuming. But once you get the hang of it, most of the tactics here will become second nature to you. You'll be whipping up sims in 5 or 10 minutes. 8-)
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Blackreign_Excel_Sim_vs._Redfox_Browser_Sim"> Blackreign Excel Sim vs. Redfox Browser Sim </span></h2>
<p>I highly recommend the excel sim. It is far superior to Redfox's browser sim in a number of ways, most notably in that tweaking is much easier. If you forget to cast harmony one hour in the browser sim, then your whole sim is wrecked. You'll have to start over. If you want to see what happens if you build 25 temples instead of 20 on hour 1, you have to start from scratch. If you accidentally underbuild farms in the beginning, then (you guessed it) you'll have to start over. The process of trial and error in Redfox's sim is a painstaking one, and some would argue that perfecting sims with it is virtually impossible.
</p><p>The excel sim, on the other hand, allows you to make adjustments on the fly. You can make any tweaks you want in a matter of seconds. The flexibility permitted with the excel sim saves an immeasurable amount of time and allows you to polish your sims to a degree that just isn't possible with the Redfox sim. The only real drawback to the Excel sim is that it requires Microsoft Excel, and it has a small learning curve. I personally got the hang of it in 10 minutes, but some people have trouble with it. Believe me when I tell you that it's absolutely worth taking the time to learn it.
</p><p>I will be writing this guide under the assumption that you are using the Excel sim. Now, if you must use the Redfox sim, this guide will probably still be useful to you. Your results will most likely not be optimal, but you can still learn a few tricks and avoid the major mistakes.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Notations"> Notations </span></h2>
<p>For the purposes of this guide, I will operate under the assumption that you live in -5 (EST), or Dominion server time. Obviously, that will probably not be the case for most of you. I live in -6 (CST) myself. This is just to simply things, and also because I set all my sims to Dominion time. If I told you to take a land bonus at 23:00, and then another at 00:00, this would be problematic for people in the other 23 timezones. It may be helpful to set your sims to Dominion time as well, and then change them back to your own time after the sims are completed.
</p><p>I will also be going by the hour 1 system. This means that the first hour of wave 1 at 0:00 will be "hour 1", 9:00 will be hour 10, and so forth. I understand that some Redfox users go by an hour 0 system, but that is just ludicrous.&#160;:roll:
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Getting_Started"> Getting Started </span></h2>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Hour_1"> Hour 1 </span></h3>
<p>Hour 1 is fairly standard. There is little variation here between attackers/explorers, or throughout different waves. In other words, everyone does pretty much the same thing. Despite what I said earlier about "rigidness", I will insist that you pretty much follow this section to the letter.
</p><p>First, set your draftrate to 90%. Don't worry, it's never going to actually reach that number. Not for a very long time, anyway. The important thing is that you're drafting as many peasants as possible to military every single hour. Even if you plan to attack on very low acres, your exploration will be limited by draftees, and you need to get those acres in as soon as possible. Once you've finished exploring, you still need to keep your draftrate maxed for training purposes. There is no such thing as too many draftees at this stage of the game.
</p><p>Speaking of draftees, you can score 150 extras right now by releasing your DP specs. Yes, you may have to retrain them later; but don't worry, the benefit of getting faster acres, alchemies, and jobs will more than make up for it.
</p><p>In recent times, Ross has changed the starting resources, which includes a whopping 10,000 gems. Don't invest them; it's not worth it. Convert them to 20k plat.
</p><p>Factories change with the <a href="/wiki/index.php/Rulesets" title="Rulesets">rulesets</a>. In the base and tech rulesets, build 56 factories. In imp ruleset, build 45. Construction costs in protection can account for as much as 30% of your plat. That is a LOT of shekels, my friend (in excess of 300k plat in some cases). Without factories (blasphemy!), this number would be much higher. The reason I advise building these exact numbers of factories is because it gives you the maximum bonus at 299 acres. 299 is a "magic number", which I will explain in more detail later.
</p><p>Build 13-15 towers. This may be a small point of contention, but I prefer to build as few towers as I can get away with. Some people build more, but I don't really see the point. 13-15 allows you to cast Harmony and Midas Touch all the way throughout protection. If you need to take ops or cast racial spells OOP, this will not be enough towers, but you can build more later on in protection. For now, just build 13-15. This number is variable because you're going to explore 29 acres in a few hours, and the amount of towers you build will depend on how soon you explore those acres. If you explore it a bit later, then you can get away with fewer towers. Don't worry too much about this for now. You can always go back and tweak it if you need more or less towers.
</p><p>Temples is a bit trickier. To be honest, it's one area that I historically have had some trouble with. You need temples to boost your population growth rate. At hour 1, your population will only be at 40-50% of it's maximum capacity, and it grows each hour very slowly. Without temples it could take 45 or more hours for your population to max out. Temples will allow this to happen much faster, which is great; because maximum population means that you're producing more plat, and you're drafting more draftees each hour. The trouble here is that we have to balance this delicately. The early stage of the sim is vital for alchemies, because this is the time at which they are most valuable. That's why we're skimping on towers, and will be destroying some buildings a bit later, so we don't want to dedicate more acres to temples than is absolutely necessary. Another issue is that there is a pseudo law of diminishing returns with temples. That is not to say that the bonus scales down, but rather that temps simply seem to be less effective (in terms of plat and draftees gained) the more you build them. Frankly, the optimal number of temples is still somewhat of a mystery to me. The best I can advise for now is a range of 15-40. Races with large population bonuses (such as Goblin and Kobold) should lean toward the higher end of that range (perhaps 30-40), since a larger population takes longer to max out and will benefit more from increased growth rate. For most other races, I would recommend 15-25. Feel free to experiment and see what gives the best results.
</p><p>Some people like to build alchemies on hour 1. I have compared the difference between building some on hour 1 and simply waiting until hour 12 to build all of them, and did not observe any significant change in plat at hour 61. Factories arrive at hour 12, so the benefit of getting those alchs 12 hours earlier is pretty much canceled out by the cost of constructing them. I have fallen into the habit of waiting for hour 12 because doing it at hour 1 can delay exploration for earlier waves. However, with the recent change of starting resources, that may no longer be case. It's a non-issue in my opinion, so do whichever you prefer.
</p>
<ul><li> <i><a href="/wiki/index.php/Ladeda" title="Ladeda">Ladeda</a> tells me that there is indeed a noticeable benefit in building alchemies on hour 1. In one specific case, he observed a difference of 6k plat by hour 61. With the increase in starting resources, it's possible now to build even more alchemies on hour 1, and perhaps save even more platinum. I'll have to look into this further, but for now I would recommend that you build as many alchs on hour 1 as is reasonably possible. However, I urge you to be careful not delay your 29 acre exploration too much. Also, it may not necessarily be beneficial to rezone additional acres this hour in order to build more alchs.</i>
</li></ul>
<p>I've given this matter further consideration, and found that sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. Strictly taking the construction cost and alchemy production into consideration, you lose plat buy building alchs on hour 1 compared to hour 12. And yet, there are times when doing this results in more platinum on hour 61. The most likely reason is that you get those jobs in 12 hours sooner, so the employment makes up the difference. I've concluded for now that building alchs on hour 1 is the best course of action most of the time. However, I urge you to test this yourself first, because there are cases where you will lose plat by doing this.
</p><p>Of course, you'll have to rezone to accommodate all this construction. Make use of all forests and caverns. If you're exploring, you can rezone the water. Some attackers may be able to rezone some water, depending on how much offense you intend to train and how efficient those units are. If you'll need to send more than 1100 units, then don't rezone any water. If your race doesn't use ore, rezone mountains. Otherwise, you may be able to spare some mountains, but it varies greatly between different races. If your race is ore intensive, then don't rezone any mountains. You can rezone plains if you must, but do so as a last resort. Only rezone as much as you need to accommodate construction this hour. Do not rezone the leftovers into plains or anything like that, because you'll want to do so at reduced cost after factories have arrived.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="The_Magic_Number"> The Magic Number </span></h3>
<p>At some point between hours 1 and 9, you should explore exactly 29 plains. The earlier you can do so, the better. The reason for doing this is so that you can stay within the 299 acre threshold for a period of time. Once you exceed 300 acres, the cost of exploration increases by one draftee. The next "magic number" is 419 acres (cost goes up 1 draftee/acre at 420), and in some cases it may be (arguably) desirable to sit on 419 acres for as long as is reasonably possible. But I'm getting ahead of myself; I'll touch more on this in the exploring patterns section. For now, take my word for it that the optimal choice is to explore 29 acres and then wait at least several hours before exploring any more.
</p><p>At this point, you should go ahead and cast all your spells in the magic tab. Cast Harmony first at hour 14, then Midas touch at hour 16. To use mana efficiently, you should then cast each spell exactly 12 hours later, meaning they will always be 2 hours apart. Some people (especially those wanting to reduce their logins) will synchronize their spells at hour 25 and every 12 hours thereafter. That's fine; it just wastes a little mana. Not a big deal, really. Don't forget to go back to the magic tab later, after the "rough draft" of your sim is finished, and make sure to stop casting Harmony once the population reaches 100%. You won't necessarily know when the population will max at this moment, so go ahead and cast it every 12 up until OOP for now.
</p><p>Now that you have explored the 29 acres and casted spells, you can go back to hour 1 and adjust the number of towers you built.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Hour_12"> Hour 12 </span></h3>
<p>Now that your factories have arrived, it's time to finish construction. But first, you should destroy some buildings. Your 10 homes are useless for now, as your population should not even be close to maxed. Destroy them (this may not be the best course of action for Troll or WE, however, due to population penalties). The game also starts you with a few more lumberyards and farms than you need. I'll be conservative and suggest that you destroy 5 of each, although many races and playstyles can destroy more. If you're going to be relatively small OOP (650 acres or less) then you should be able to destroy 10 of each. Once the "rough draft" of your sim is complete, check the production tab and see if you have surpluses of food or lumber. If so, go back and destroy more. Be careful with the farms, though. You want to leave yourself at least 24 hours of cushion between OOP and the time that you begin starving. This will give you ample time to rebuild farms as needed.
</p><p>Now build ore mines an docks as needed, and rezone all remaining barren land to plains. Then build all of it into alchemies. Like I mentioned earlier, alchemies are vital (especially this early), which is why we're making cuts to homes/LYs/farms. We want to squeeze in as many alchs as possible.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Exploring_Patterns"> Exploring Patterns </span></h2>
<p>There are two extremes here. The lax "12233445" style of exploring every 11 hours, and the hardcore "1:55" style of exploring every single hour.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="12233445"> 12233445 </span></h3>
<p>This term was coined eons ago, back when Redfox had a monopoly on the simming business. It stands for the hours during which one explores; hour 12, hour 23, hour 34, and hour 45. The point of exploring every 11 hours is to reduce costs as much as possible. The larger you are, the more each acre will cost to explore. So if you explore a batch at hour 12, the cost of exploring goes way up at hour 24; but at hour 23, the cost is the same as it was at hour 12 because you are still on the same landsize. 12233445 is the most cost effective (cheap) method of exploring.
</p><p>This is the method of choice for low maintenance sims, tailored for people with busy lives who can't make a lot of logins. Doing it this way does save the most plat (and perhaps draftees if "magic numbers" are taken into consideration), but it comes at a great cost: It stagnates the growth of your economy. Even if your population is growing consistently, the jobs come in sporadic chunks, resulting in long periods of low employment. Your peasants need jobs to produce platinum, and delaying exploration subsequently delays construction. The platinum saved exploring every 11 hours does not necessarily make up for the income lost.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="1:55"> 1:55 </span></h3>
<p>A 1:55er is a hardcore player who wakes up in the night to make logins every single hour. Wake up at 3:55 AM, make a login, wait 6 minutes, make another login at 4:01, then sleep for 1 hour and 55 minutes. Then wake up and repeat the process.
</p><p>If you want to explore every hour, and you're not an insomniac, you'll have to 1:55 it. Now, I mentioned earlier that you should explore 29 acres and then wait at least several hours before exploring the next batch. This is usually true even for the 1:55 style; the draftees saved by observing the magic number of 299 is too great to ignore. But after that large batch you will continue exploring every subsequent hour. This allows the population to grow and jobs to roll in consistently, resulting in a great economy; but it is also the most expensive method of exploring. Each hour, the cost of exploration is higher than the last.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Which_Style_is_Better.3F">Which Style is Better? </span></h3>
<p>It depends. Usually, the optimal choice is somewhere in between. If you're coming out on low acres, it's usually best to explore those acres as soon as possible and 1:55 it. The overall cost of exploring is going to be relatively small anyway, so getting the economy rolling takes precedent. Running a pure 12233445 strat is never optimal for any playstyle. Large explorers/converters might want to do a few 11 hour batches and then 1:55 it, since the overall cost of exploring will be obscenely high, so the "11 houring" will save a lot of plat. An exception to this is Goblin and Kobold, who have large populations, and thus a higher demand for employment. In general, you should 1:55 with them.
</p><p>"Batches" don't always have to be 11 hours apart. Smaller batches of 5-8 hours still save plat, and can sometimes be desirable when taking time constraints under consideration (such as land bonuses). Sometimes people carefully manipulate batches to take advantage of the 2nd magic number of 419.
</p><p>When I spoke of complex intricacies in the introduction, this is one of the things I was talking about. This is partly what separates the men from the boys, but nobody has it down to an exact science. I encourage you to experiment with different patterns and see what works best for your race/strat.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Thar.27s_Gold_in_them_thar_Plains.21"> Thar's Gold in them thar Plains! </span></h2>
<p>Whichever pattern you use to explore, one variable will remain constant: Plains! Explore plains up the whazoo. With a few exceptions (which I will talk about later), you should explore only plains up until hour 37. Although alchemies decrease in value as time goes on (in regards to hour 61 plat), they are still the foundation of all great sims. We still want to squeeze in as many as possible. You will also need plains to build smithies, which are mandatory for all races in protection (even gnome).
</p><p>No matter what race/style you are playing, you must build the maximum smithies in your respective ruleset. That is 18% in the base ruleset, 15% in the imp ruleset, and 20% in the tech ruleset. There are a few very rare exceptions to this, which are hardly worth mentioning, but I"ll throw one out there any: Exploring Kobolds running pure spec DP should not build smithies, ever (not even in protection).
</p><p>The reason we stop exploring plains at hour 37 is because the acres will arrive at hour 49, and those buildings will be constructed at hour 61; just in time for training. Beyond that, alchemies and smithies are no longer useful (as far as protection is concerned). If you're a low-acre attacker, you may not need to explore beyond hour 37 anyway. But if you're coming out on high acres, then I recommend exploring hills (for GTs or possibly barracks), caverns (for DMs if you plan to run imps or schools if you plan to tech), or your racial landtype (for homes, or races with specific land dependencies) after hour 37. I will discuss the merits of building GTs and homes/rax in protection a bit later.
</p><p>When constructing your plains, make sure that smithies are built last. I'll give a simplified example. If you explore exactly 10 plains every hour between hours 18-37, and you'll need 100 smithies for the maximum bonus, then construct alchemies on hours 30-39, and then build smithies on hours 40-49. Smithies will give the same bonus no matter what time you build them, but alchemies decrease in value over time. The earlier you build them, the more benefits they give.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Jumping_off_the_Plain_Train"> Jumping off the Plain Train </span></h2>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, there are a few times when you may want to explore different landtypes in the first 37 hours.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Factories"> Factories </span></h3>
<p>This is a great cost-cutting trick for high acre sims. If you're exploring 700+ acres, then factories (in moderation) will usually save you more plat early on than the almighty alchs. In some cases, this could earn you as much as 130k plat, or perhaps even more! If your race has hills as its racial landtype, then using your first daily bonus for factories is a great solution, especially if you can sync it so that the factories arrive at the same time as your first explore batch. Otherwise, you may consider exploring hills with some of the 29 acres you took at the beginning. If you're coming OOP on 800+ acres, you may even benefit from even more factories, and explore some hills with your first batch. Much like temples, however, there is a pseudo law of diminishing returns. Don't go overboard with the factories. Experiment with it and see what gives the best results.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Towers"> Towers </span></h3>
<p>If you need to take ops OOP, or need to cast your racial spell somewhat frequently, then the initial 12-15 towers will not be enough. Explore some swamps, but time it carefully. Alchemies take priority, so doing this too early will be costly. After you have finished the rough draft of your sim, pinpoint the exact hour that you stopped building alchs and switched to smithies. Instead of building those very last alchs, build swamps that hour[s], then switch to the explore tab and swap the plains with swamps 12 hours prior to the time you built towers. This tactic will henceforth be referred to as clipping.
</p><p>You may also be able to get away with exploring the swamps after hour 37 (if you'll be exploring that much). This saves you plat, since you won't be interfering with alch construction, but will result in less mana by OOP.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Farms"> Farms </span></h3>
<p>Okay, these are actually on plains, but this is sort of relevant to what I've been talking about in this section. Sometimes it's better to destroy extra farms on hour 12, and then rebuild the farms later. This allows you to have more alchemies early, which is when they are most valuable. Just like you did with the towers, us the clipping trick and replace the very last alchs you built with farms.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="When_to_Take_Daily_Bonuses"> When to Take Daily Bonuses </span></h2>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Platinum_Bonus"> Platinum Bonus </span></h3>
<p>This one is easy. Just take it whenever your peasants are at their highest. For the first 2 days, this will be at 23:00 about 99% of the time. Check the population tab of your excel sim to be sure. One exception to this rule is on the 3rd day if your peasantry peaks past hour 61. So for day 3, take the bonus before hour 62, whenever the peasants are highest.
</p><p>Sometimes people take the platinum bonus at suboptimal times for specific reasons. If you want to do a big explore batch on one particular hour, or something like that, then it's okay to take the bonus at the expense of a few hundred plat. Just don't force the issue if it means passing up thousands of platinum; it's probably not worth it then.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Land_Bonus"> Land Bonus </span></h3>
<p>This is a small point of contention among some people. I usually prefer to take the land bonus as late as possible to reduce exploring costs. That means 23:00 for the first day. The 2nd day depends on how much I'm exploring. If I finish exploring before hour 37, then I'll take the bonus right after I've explored my last acres. Otherwise, I take it at 23:00. On day 3, if I'm still exploring, then I take the bonus after I've explored my last acres. Otherwise, I take it at 0:00.
</p><p>Sometimes it's okay to take the bonus a bit earlier; it just depends how much you're giving up in terms of exploration costs. But for the love of God, do not take your land bonus on hour 1. It's a classic noob mistake, and many people use this as a barometer to measure how bad their realm is (if you're in a realm full of 270s right when the game starts, you're in trouble&#160;:cry: ).
</p><p>If you want to take the bonus earlier, try it in the sim and see what happens. It might not cost you more than an acre or two. If you wanted to build factories with your bonus at a specific time, and can do so without hurting yourself too much, then by all means go right ahead. Sometimes the benefit of getting jobs sooner outweigh the detriment of increased explore costs. Again, I encourage you to experiment and see what works best.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Exploring_Beyond_Hour_37"> Exploring Beyond Hour 37 </span></h2>
<p>Some of you, namely attackers, won't make it this far. But for those who do, there are several options.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Hills"> Hills </span></h3>
<p>GTs are a fine option for high acre explorers/converters. The benefits are rather short-term, and some people don't like to build them in protection; but if you want to come out huge OOP (850+ acres), then this is pretty much the only way to pull it off. It's also great for races with expensive DP elites such as Merfolk and Troll. Some people like to destroy factories to build extra GTs. I strongly advise against this. Even if you destroy the factories 1 at a time and build the GTs one at a time, it is a waste of plat 90% of the time. The plat you save on military does not make up for the increased cost of constructing GTs in the first place, not to mention the increased cost of future construction. If you want to build GTs, then explore the hills or use daily bonuses.
</p><p>Barracks don't reap the immediate rewards that GTs do, but they set you up for a stronger economy beyond protection. There are some races that should never build barracks under any circumstances, such as Goblin and Kobold (and arguably lycanthrope and spirit/undead) because homes are clearly the superior choice due to their population bonuses. If you intend to run diamond mines at some point in the round, then barracks are generally a poor choice. Then again, some people like to run barracks in moderation early on, for a better population boost, and then switch to homes later after getting improvements. Barracks are a particularly great building for races with population penalties such as Troll, since it takes an unreasonably high keep&#160;% to make homes the better choice.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Caverns"> Caverns </span></h3>
<p>If you're doing a tech or imp strat, then by all means, go this route.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Racial_Landtypes"> Racial Landtypes </span></h3>
<p>This is pretty much mandatory for land dependent races such as Sylvan and Nox. There's not much else to say about that, really.
</p><p>Homes are a fine choice, especially for races with population bonuses. Like barracks, this really kicks your economy into gear. Just be careful not to overbuild them. If you're going to be huge OOP, it may possible for your peasants to outnumber your jobs, which makes homes redundant and results in unemployment. You can check employment rates on the exploration tab. As long as it's 100%, continue building homes to your heart's content.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Polishing_and_Tweaking"> Polishing and Tweaking </span></h2>
<p>Now that you have a rough draft of your sim, it's time to go through it with a comb and make some adjustments. Don't worry about training military just yet. We'll save that for last.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Negative_Resources"> Negative Resources </span></h3>
<p>Many of these issues have already been addressed, but let's give it a second pass. Go to the production tab and look for red cells. These are negative resources, which the sim allows, but this is not compatible with reality. This happens sometimes when you tweak things, especially early on in the sim. It will have to be corrected.
</p><p>If you have negative food at any point, you'll have to build more farms. You should avoid going back to hour 12 and destroying fewer farms. This will have nasty repercussions on platinum, since it means building fewer of those precious alchs. The better choice is to use the clipping tactic outlined in the "Jumping off the Plain Train" section.
</p><p>Ditto for towers. Make sure you'll have enough mana by OOP. Speaking of which, now is a good time to go through your spells and stop casting harmony once the population has reached 98-100%
</p><p>If you find yourself short on lumber, you have several choices. The least desirable one is to go back to hour 12 and destroy fewer LYs. If the lumber runs out late in the sim, you may be able to do some clipping and explore a few forests. If you have plat to spare, you can use the national bank to convert some lumber, but try not to rely too heavily on this. If your lumber shortage is mild, sometimes the easiest way to correct the problem is to simply construct fewer buildings that hour[s] and pick up the slack in later hours.
</p><p>If you're short on platinum, your options are limited. If you have excess lumber or ore, convert it to platinum (just make sure that THOSE resources will eventually go negative as a result). Aside from that, all you can do is spend less plat. The most effective way of cutting down on platinum is to explore less. Go to the hours with negative plat and chip away at exploration until you're out of the red.
</p><p>Now go to the construction tab and check the colored columns on the left. There is a good chance that some of these cells will be in red as a result of your prior adjustments. These are easily fixed. Just construct fewer buildings those hours until you're out of the red. You should also check for any surpluses of barren acres (any cell in those columns that does not read 0) and build them if possible.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Everybody.27s_Workin.27_on_the_Weekend"> Everybody's Workin' on the Weekend </span></h2>
<p>So, you don't have the time to 1:55 it? Your job or school won't permit you to make 50-60 logins? You want a piece of my heart? Wanna be in the show?
</p><p>Wait, what was I talking about?
</p><p>Oh, right. The best sims usually require a ton of logins, but we can't all be hardcore, can we? Depending on your level of activity, trimming down the logins will not necessarily hurt your sim too much. Just determine which hours you can not log in, and delay those actions for later. For example, if your sim has you exploring 10 acres each hour between 2:00 AM and 7:00 AM, and you want to sleep for some reason (you wuss =P) , then simply cut out those logins and explore all 60 acres at 7:00. A great way to trim logins, which I mentioned earlier, is to sync up your spells so that they're cast at the same time (instead of 2 hours apart).
</p><p>The quality of your sim depends a lot on your level of activity. It's possible to make a decent sim on 22 logins, but it won't be anything special. If you take a hardcore 50-60 login sim and cut it down to 40, it won't necessarily hurt that much. I've seen a lot of fantastic sims with 40ish logins. The most important thing is to make sure that your sim is compatible with reality, because if you can't emulate the sim in real life, then it's worthless.
</p><p>Be warned that some logins simply can not be eliminated. If you can't be around at hour 61 and hour 63 to train military, then you're screwed. Choose your wave wisely if this is an issue, or perhaps find a less demanding hobby. Go find yourself a hot date or something. Everybody wants a little romance. 8-)
</p><p><br />

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Finishing_Your_Sim"> Finishing Your Sim </span></h2>
<p>This is it! The moment of truth! Swim on down to hour 61 and see how much shiny platinum and ore you have.
</p><p>Now you train troops. It's not exactly rocket science, is it? Go to the log tab, generate a log, and brag to all your friends about the sweet stats in your l33t sim. Don't forget to save your work. You did good, kid. Now you're ready to take on the world!
