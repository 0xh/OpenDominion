</p><p>Advancements In Your Dominion
<br />No Advancements are currently affecting your Dominion
</p><p>My pack: Merf., Luann, Jiriky, Tetre, Vjs, and Pred
</p><p>Our goal: Just going out there and bashing people in. I mean thats why
I choose goblin, they are extremely killable, and have a real hard time late
round but I liked the +5% attack bonus vs Good so me and Jiri played them.
</p><p>I started out the round very poorly, I only managed to grab a little over 100 acres, but thats where the 9hr attack came into really really helping me out. With the early game I had noticed that there were limited amount of people out there as attackers and threats. So when the Lair came out I said to jiriky you know what, we might actually be able to win this.
</p><p>Thats when we brought in the raiders and as a realm grabbed the wonder from 0. It was a good gamble and it paid off. The only bad result was that roughly 50% of dominion peaced us. This resulted in me and jiriky pumping more offense to hit, but it affected the rest of our realm really negatively.
</p><p>If you cant hit continously you start to slow down and your economy goes right out the window. Thats what happened to the rest of my realm, not only were they not getting any prestige (a must for mid to top level attackers) but they had to pay more for offense and receive less land in the process. It was really demoralizing to see that happen.
</p><p>But we all trucked on and basically just said bring it on. At this stage there were 4 main contenders and threats to deal with. 38 FW, 22 Merfolks, 11 Sinfest and the 3-4 suicidal lizzies (they are a seperate matter though) We took down each threat eventually.
</p><p>First and foremost we had to deal with our biggest threats both 22 Merfolks. They were a real pain especially with 4 ops ppl helping them along 24/7.
They struck first and luckily bounced on jiriky. I retalled the next hr and took my revenge. This slowed one of them down. The other one was still going strong though. He decided he was going to try and out grow me so he had sent out, but his realmies were not stupid and knew i was waiting for him to do this because i had alot of draftees stored for a raider pump. They killed almost all of my draftees off that hr and so the merfolk sent out. That same hr i had around one minute to think of a plan to bang this merfolk, i just thought to myself did i need these spies and wiz (nahhhh) so i released almost everything and mass pumped raiders. This caught the merfolk off guard and we managed to gang bang him.
</p><p>12:24:08 AM Citadel of Darkness (# 53) invaded Charybdis (# 22) and captured 183 land.
12:13:34 AM Dracula (# 53) invaded Charybdis (# 22) and captured 191 land.
</p><p>The threat from 22 merfolks was finally ended when jiriky later banged the last one when he tried exploring. But they both ended up deleting anyways.
</p><p>The 38 Firewalker (Turbulence) was a continuous pain he basically was the reason i had no forests. He wasnt a real threat to me but he was to my pack mates, and when I finally got him i felt good.
</p><p>11 Sinfest (Ladeda) was one hell of a pain, like how do you kill the undead? The way I tried to do it was continuously dropping guard and bottom feeding him after he had built his land, to try and slow him. This worked a lil bit but eventually he got up to where me and jiriky were. I knew this was one of our main threats late game just because he had a good Suicide ability and he is undead. But luckily he eventually died off (in a matter of speaking)
</p><p>The suicidal Lizzies are were my biggest concern after 22 was dealt with. There were like 6 of them out there and you best believe I was scared of them all. They all had 5-4 chams against me and would definately suicide me if one got the chance. Like when the one suicided on Jiriky, I promptly risked getting black oped by droping guard and smaking the suicider. Then I moved on to 11 lizzies and well hit one of them all in and left the other one be, I just wanted to send them a message basically leave the lair alone or you will get hit all in.
</p><p>I will say one thing about 51 gobbo, you are a joke. Who plays gobbo to jump into top ops range and sit there pumping defense 24/7 for weeks straight, I had a laught at every single cs i got seeing those shammy go through the roof and just eventually killing yourself off. 
</p><p>When everything was settled in Half the pack had been killed off and basically only Luann myself jiriky and tetre were around.
</p><p>This is the point where I lost my patience with tetre, who wants to hear oh my chams are dying blah blah (more whining) you just suck it up and get the OPS. Another thing that really irritated me was he never sent at wonders, but convenently as soon as we got our wonder he was online to send out. Sure he help with some ops and draft killings but who wants to play with a god damn baby that has sold his packs loc out and cries 24/7.
</p><p>My realm was amazing. They helped with every part of my success. They helped with wonders, Ops, and draft killing and i Just want to say thanks to them.
</p><p>Luann you get your paragraph here. If you only would have listened to my advice about lizzie (booooooooo), but hey learned something eh. But i really would not be where i was without you, you kept me motivated and helped EXTREMELY with ops and everything else. You are the best team player a pack could and would ever want.
</p><p>Jiriky I really wish you didnt delete, and you know I said what I had said over pure disgust of listening to sids. (a down and out player who thinks he knows 100% of the game dynamics at all stages of the game) I will have to teach sids a lesson. Thats why I play this game, to teach ppl who run their mouthes off a lesson or 2.
</p><p>And ya basically after Jiriky had deleted I lost interest and kind of "coasted" to the end of the rd. Along the way I came into contact with Pimpmaster (Hanson) and we brokered a deal.
</p><p>Its all good, diplomacy is what makes this game so good, you need it to succeed. If you dont use it you know ppl will use it against you.
</p><p>Now its the end. Good. Late rd sucks and is way too boring for my liking.
</p><p>Now to all of you dirty no good whores who want a piece of me, come get some. Ill be waiting to take each and every one of you out.
