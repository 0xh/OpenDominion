<p>This was before Hobbits had to be renamed to <a href="/wiki/index.php/Halfling" title="Halfling">Halfling</a> due to Hobbit being a trademark.

<p>Round 2 has only just finished as I write this. We are now in a testing phase before the start of round 3. In this round, we were allowed to form our own realms for the first time. The realm I created included myself (Fun Between the Sheets), Macros (Oh Man I am HOT), Aye Cue (Fornication Fortification), Ruthless Regent (Bumping Uglies), Sir G (Eighteen is Legal), and Majk (Mean n Green Sex Machine). We got off to a pretty bad start, being consolidated with a multi (oops! There goes half our realm!), and then missing out on a wonder (due to the staggered starting times). Nonetheless, our individual dominions did very well. A week or so into the round, we got our 7th dominion, and then occaisionally over the next few weeks, we picked up a few more (eventually, we finished with 10 dominions).
</p><p>Early this round, Master P (and much of his realm) was deleted for babysitting, so he didn't have much play in the rest of this round.
</p><p>Unfortunately for me, I had computer trouble, and was unable to play for a week. This (obviously) put me way off the pace. Particularly combined with some people who discovered my location and identity, and decided to hit me to prevent a repeat of Round 1. So it goes I suppose.... When I returned, Macros was firmly in the top 3 dominions, and Aye Cue, Fitter and G were all in the top 20. Majk was top 50. I went into catch-up mode.
</p><p>It was shortly after I returned that Light decided that he had been unfairly treated (4 grabs in a short period) and that he was going to kill those responsible (including Rippman, Kamatsu (Dash), Kancer, and Macros. He managed to destroy Kamatsu, and hurt Rippman before he was sufficiently reduced in size to be of no more consequence.
</p><p>Two large Dark Elves decided to kill me after being grabbed by larger members of our realm, further hindering my recovery. It took some effort to beat them to below my Royal Guard range, considering that both started out larger than I was.
</p><p>Pella suicided on Macros (again) and then deleted. It's becoming a tradition.
</p><p>Macros around this time had some troubles with another very large Goblin, Guardian of the Realm. They both started hitting each other, and both suffered accordingly, losing acres. Guardian was effectively destroyed in the conflict, to the great benefit of Chicken Tonight (Big Balls in round 1) who ended up WAY ahead, effectively winning the round.
</p><p>Plikt (Queen of Hearts) hit our realm for the second time as well, earning a place on our "to hit" list.
</p><p>Majk quit around this time, allowing both myself and Macros to regain some recently lost
acres.
</p><p>Around this time, Toyota (Red Suns FC (ex Toyota Nizmo VTEC)) attacked Stretch (Chicken Tonight), for a LARGE amount of acres (over 1000). As a result, Stretch's realm hit back, precipitating a war between the two realms. Most of Red Suns' realm eventually quit.
</p><p>At this point, Chicken Tonight was the top dominion, and his realm-mate, Tea Pot was number 2. They had something of a lead over the rest of the world, with plikt's realm doing pretty well too.
</p><p>Another realm decided that plikt (Queen of Hearts) had annoyed them a little too much. His realm (Wonderland) had repeatedly attacked theirs (Da Main Domain). Since plikt was on our "to hit" list, we joined in and razed a couple of times. The result of that episode was that plikt suicided, and allowed Cheshire Cat (also in Wonderland) to take his acres. This put CC in the top few dominions, and Da Main Domain decided to reduce him as well. In short order, he was significantly smaller too. The rest of Wonderland was beaten heavily, since Da Main Domain included two very large Dark Elves (Domain (Vargomad) and Golden Wings Domain (Emile)), capable of doing a LOT of damage. Wonderland eventually tried to retaliate on me, but by that time, they were too small to have any real effect.
</p><p>Simultaneously with our bashing of Wonderland, some top dominions (including Rako, Jedi, Vogon, Solace and Ljuvliga Ljung) decided they wanted to break the power of Stretch's realm (190). They launched an attack, and succeeded in hurting Stretch and
Tea Pot, but not in causing any serious damage. Voreth (Vogon) was really the only one to come out ahead, gaining many acres. Zendog (Chicken Fried Steak, also in Stretch's realm) dropped acres to his realm mates after being bashed.
</p><p>The next major event was when Stretch attacked Angel. Attacking Angel is generally a Bad Move unless you REALLY have the guns to support it. It's dangerous, as she has a habit of retaliating, hard. It was particularly bad in this case, since Angel was friends with Tea Pot. Now, Angel called in a bunch of her allies, to attack 190, as she felt that Stretch's attack was in contravention of a non-agression pact (NAP) between their realms that she had made with Tea Pot. Stretch didn't realise that there was such an agreement, and as such, did not feel bound by it. Tea Pot refused to attack Angel, as hefelt that Stretch was in the wrong, and various members of 190 decided that this was disloyalty to the realm, and started to attack him. Tea Pot defected and deleted his dominion. 190 was hurt badly, and their dominance of the ranks was over, though Stretch remained the top dominion.
</p><p>We also had an undead decide to run the hellswarm tactic; severe overpopulation. Pestilence was the name of the dominion involved, and he had something like 120k vampires on not very much land (like, 1k acres). He was eventually killed through fireballs, and Ross announced that such a strategy will no longer work next round.
</p><p>That was most of the excitement for the round, and the final reckoning saw The Fun Realm (including Solace, Kancer, Graeyn, Liorean and Mortal Wombat) take number 1 land, our realm take number two (with Ruthless and Aye Cue in 2nd and 3rd places for land), and the Second Coming (including various members of my round 1 realm) take top spot for networth. I finished ranked 15th for land.
</p><p>This round saw the introduction of Ross' storyline (as well as the merfolk race) which added another element to the game, particularly when races gained bonuses against others....
