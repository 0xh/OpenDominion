<p>Round 46 was won by technically three <a href="/wiki/index.php/Runaway" title="Runaway">runaway attackers</a>. The story is told by the three winners. 
</p>
<a name="Roundwin_Stories" id="Roundwin_Stories"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline"> Roundwin Stories </span></h1>
<p>Here are the roundwin stories written by Rio, Fingal, and Ladeda, respectively. 
</p>
<a name="Rio.27s_Story" id="Rio.27s_Story"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Rio's Story </span></h2>
<p>We decided that going Good would be a nice choice this round and hoped we'd be the top Good pack so that we could take ToB without too much trouble when it came out. Looking at races, Bell had decided on merf, ladeda and fingal both wanted dorf. I was torn between sylvan, FW and halfer. I wanted to show that sylvan were still playable but when Ross gave halfer 40% reduced cas making them super-charged FWs, the choice was made for me. ladeda had made a pretty decent sim for me that I tweaked with different buildings and came up with an impressive OP 12 hours out. By reading the boards and suggested DPs, I would be able to hit a LOT of people 12 hours after wave 6 came OOP. I gave the sim to Margarita so she picked halfer too. I do kinda feel bad that we convinced Dreki to go sylvan since he really wanted human instead but we were after speed and ops help with wiz races (especially DEs) so we pretty much forced him into it (sorry bud).
</p><p>After going with a slow race last round, and wussing out from do-or-die strats in the past, I decided this would be the one where I'd go crazy specs and mods early. The plan was for me to go out as fast as possible and to take out as many Good attackers as I could and then have fingal and ladeda going fast as well tucked in right behind me for when my inefficiency started to hurt, so that they could then take over and cover me. I also kinda figured I'd get caught out at some point and then I'd switch to ops bitz for the others which is another reason as to why I was thinking of halfer in the first place.
</p><p>Anyway, our pack was:
<br />- emo songs making me 4:3 - Halfling (me)
<br />- hanging around after 4:3 - Dwarf (ladeda)
<br />- Santa 4:3s muslim kids. - Dwarf (fingal)
<br />- 4:3 Is always an Option - Merfolk (BigBell)
<br />- Water is 4:3s to grow! - Halfing (Margarita)
<br />- I fourthree a lot of fun - Sylvan (Dreki) - got deleted by a friend Week 6... silly Dreki not logging out properly
</p><p>During protection, we realised that we had also landed with James (Mushroom Cloud - Halfer) who Dreki and fingal had played with before so they brought him into our pack channel straight away. He was awesome for ops help right from the start.
</p><p>Day 4/50 - OOP
</p><p>Protection: Wave 1, 611 land - 6.2k OP, 4k DP.
</p><p>1:01:29 AM Victorious on the battlefield, emo songs making me 4:3 (# 6) conquered 29 land from -Odin- (# 51).
<br />3:05:14 AM Victorious on the battlefield, emo songs making me 4:3 (# 6) conquered 40 land from GoodJob 88 (# 45).
<br />3:05:22 AM Victorious on the battlefield, emo songs making me 4:3 (# 6) conquered 35 land from GoodJob 88 (# 45).
<br />3:05:39 AM Victorious on the battlefield, emo songs making me 4:3 (# 6) conquered 31 land from GoodJob 88 (# 45).
<br />4:19:52 AM Victorious on the battlefield, emo songs making me 4:3 (# 6) conquered 43 land from Elysia (# 9).
</p><p>11/24/2007 2:58:15 PM The game has automatically removed 43 acres of land because of apparent land farming of Elysia (# 9).
</p><p>Apparently people thought I farmed. I hit from 611 (not 631 as some people thought) and made 265 acres from 6.2k OP. I actually came OOP wave 1 and didn't hit at all first wave because of no decent targets. Same story for wave 3. Wave 5 had loads of farms it seemed but by then I only had enough for 1 hit anyway which ended up being <a href="/wiki/index.php/Scripting" title="Scripting">scripted</a> 10 hours later. It sucked because I sent 1.7k OP at it instead of 1.1-1.3k like all the other hits. fingal lost 64 land from the same hit being <a href="/wiki/index.php/Scripting" title="Scripting">scripted</a> as he hit it before me. To say he was a little annoyed would be a gross understatement.
</p><p>However, even with the <a href="/wiki/index.php/Scripting" title="Scripting">scripted</a> acres, I was top attacker 12 hours out, and for targets, I had the choice of 4th strongest NW (me, ladeda, fingal were top 3) - Mindstorm (#21) (a liz) or a gnome explorer with 48 more acres but also more DP. Decided to go for the gnome for more land and less rezoning for mods:
</p><p>5:59:47 PM Victorious on the battlefield, emo songs making me 4:3 (# 6) conquered 63 land from Tywyn (# 14). (97.5%)
</p><p>Day 5/50
</p><p>We took a look at any Good threats to our dorfs but we dominated the strongest Good ranks. For most of the first 2 weeks, we had top 3 strongest and Bell kept moving between 4th and 6th strongest Good. I concentrated on hitting Evil attackers instead:
</p><p>5:03:55 AM Victorious on the battlefield, emo songs making me 4:3 (# 6) conquered 54 land from Who Switch Off Da Lights! (# 42). (84.5%)
<br />5:59:33 PM Victorious on the battlefield, emo songs making me 4:3 (# 6) conquered 65 land from Propaganda (# 42). (89.8%)
</p><p>"Arrived at: 11/25/2007 6:00:35 PM
<br />you are one lucky dude your mates didnt fail any more ops on me I was ready to release all my swords&nbsp;:-/
<br />-Minister . of Propaganda (# 42) "
<br />(Sorry Rondrraai, but you told ladeda that's what you were planning before you knew where we were&nbsp;:p I kept checking realm page before I hit to see if there was a NW drop)
</p><p>Day 6/60
</p><p>Next hit was fun:
</p><p>"Arrived at: 11/26/2007 5:38:39 AM
<br />you can stop looking. you do not have the offence needed&nbsp;;)
<br />-Lord Spider of 0ld School Insect (# 33)"
</p><p>5:54:45 AM Victorious on the battlefield, emo songs making me 4:3 (# 6) conquered 65 land from 0ld School Insect (# 33). (83.2%)
</p><p>"Arrived at: 11/26/2007 9:53:56 AM
<br />wtf GN?&nbsp;:)
<br />-Lord Spider of 0ld School Insect (# 33)"
</p><p>5:25:11 PM Victorious on the battlefield, emo songs making me 4:3 (# 6) conquered 71 land from Mindstorm (# 21). (83.9%)
<br />(the liz I passed on Day 4 - he and his kobold looked like a huge threat together. Mindstorm had hit another threat at the time - Snargle (# 19) (Orc) but Snargle was able to retal when his troops returned after my hit on Mindstorm so we had 2 threats taking big hits)
</p><p>By the end of Day 6 it looked very promising, land-wise so I made sure to start taking this log seRiously:

</p><p>Since Kobold are way NW-inflated, we were in a good position with just one non-kobbo(and no Good doms other than our pack filling out the top 10.
</p><p>Day 7/50
</p><p>5:58:44 AM Victorious on the battlefield, emo songs making me 4:3 (# 6) conquered 75 land from Few Seconds Left (# 23). (82.8%)
</p><p>I got bored during the day and decided to spec pump to see if I could catch one of the larger attackers or explorers. Unfortunately, all the biggest ones must have caught it and stayed home or drafted up so I had to "settle" for hitting an explorer in 8th place at the time:
</p><p>6:59:15 PM Victorious on the battlefield, emo songs making me 4:3 (# 6) conquered 90 land from Retard on Wolf Back (# 39). (86.5%)
</p><p>Day 8/50
</p><p>By now, I had pushed to top OP and someone on IRC mentioned at this point that it was funny that Goblins didn't need to defend me all out, just all in. They did the smart thing and trained just enough DP all in and sent whenever I did. I managed this speed by going almost entirely spec DP and mostly elite OP (since staff masters kick ass).
</p><p>Anyway, I had 2 potential hits lined up for the hour my troops were home. We planned for me to hit and then ladeda to double whoever we picked. Just before I hit, I BS'd #42 goblins as they had been playing with high draftees all round and I knew a spec pump would be coming. They had also pumped huge temples so it was obvious what would happen. Merf (Night #42) had done as expected and pumped a load of OP specs to catch me out. So we sunk him:
</p><p>2:15:38 PM We have declared WAR on OMGZ! Runaway Shorties! (# 42)!
</p><p>That got him down to about 80% sendable OP which was enough to get a hit but he was underdefended if he did hit still. So then I decided to hit his packmate, jiriky (Tattoo #42). Unfortunately I was in too much of a frenzy when I went to hit... we assassinated his drafts randomly for a couple hours then right when I went to hit he wall-pumped and released 200 units into draftees. I could have hit him easily anyway but I calced him without the release and didn't notice it when I got a fresh CS seconds earlier so...
</p><p>5:55:24 PM Sadly, the forces of emo songs making me 4:3 (# 6) were beaten back by Tattoo (# 42). (would have been 88.5% with Peace)
</p><p>Day 9/50
</p><p>It was frustrating as now (#42) were becoming way pretty strong. Tattoo had overtaken me with my bounce so instead of me being 250 acres ahead, he was 20 ahead. I just had to get back to hitting so I hit an explorer:
</p><p>7:59:27 AM Victorious on the battlefield, emo songs making me 4:3 (# 6) conquered 95 land from Squish Face (# 56). (82.2%).
</p><p>The followed up with another:
</p><p>7:58:07 PM Victorious on the battlefield, emo songs making me 4:3 (# 6) conquered 102 land from World Ending 2012! (# 30). (81.7%)
</p><p>Day 10/50
</p><p>At this point, I had the lead back so we had to start calculating 4:3 from ~6 different threats which with varying degrees of temples and diplomacy is a nightmare! That's all we did pretty much whenever we planned to send. I planned to hit an explorer without Peace at midday my time but was just shy so I pumped specs to get him 9 hours later. Meanwhile, (#17) kobbo had managed to get a hit in against Night (#42) and a couple hours before my specs arrived, the kobbo resent on World Ending (#30). We calced the kobbo through his lost troops and found I would be about 2k short. I would have preferred to hit the explorer without Peace since I could hit him much more safely but ladeda was afraid of future threats and thought this was a good chance to hit one down so we decided to assassinate draftees. 4 of us assassinated him and when we CS'd we found he had trained some also. I had to send out Master Thieves for the first time in order to be sure:
</p><p>5:49:06 PM Victorious on the battlefield, emo songs making me 4:3 (# 6) conquered 110 land from Never Been (# 17). (86.7% with Peace)
</p><p>Sadly, Ropin Riolis was slain in battle. &lt;-------------------------- GREATEST HERO NAME EVER (so far)... I shall miss him...
</p><p>Day 11/50
</p><p>At this point, Star Ocean (# 42) Liz had been pumping suicidal OP for some time now. He could have easily hit safely but didn't. He would be in range of me if he took land DBs and I didn't so I woke up at 5AM my time to take DB in order to be out of range... I was a few seconds too late. It sucked because if I hit the explorer, I would have been safe as I wouldn't have needed to send out Master Thieves on him:
</p><p>12/1/2007 12:00:25 AM An army from Star Ocean (# 42) invaded our lands, conquering 190 acres of land! We lost 223 draftees, 0 Slingers, 768 Defenders, 5 Staff Masters and 103 Master Thieves during the battle.
</p><p>This was the point where I started thinking about converting to ops bitz for the others if I got hit again. It never crossed my mind to delete because that would be uber gay to the pack. But when I looked at my position, I was still top attacker though and would be more help to the pack sticking with attacking so figured I'd just keep on going and see what happened.
</p><p>The hit by Star Ocean was a full on suicide so once my troops returned, we lined him up:
</p><p>5:13:23 AM Victorious on the battlefield, emo songs making me 4:3 (# 6) conquered 95 land from Star Ocean (# 42). (75.6% with Peace from them and War from us)
<br />5:17:03 AM Victorious on the battlefield, hanging around after 4:3 (# 6) conquered 89 land from Star Ocean (# 42).
<br />5:20:04 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Santa 4:3s muslim kids. (# 6) conquered 87 land from Star Ocean (# 42).
<br />5:23:35 AM Sadly, the forces of 4:3 Is always an Option (# 6) were beaten back by Star Ocean (# 42). (Bell is an idiot as he mistyped on invade screen)
</p><p>In the evening, we decided to take Obelisk from (#42). Even though I was top dom at the time and back on the verge of running, we realised that I'd need to send if we wanted to take it quickly so I sent on it. Bell, in an act of drunken madness decided to semi-suicide on a hit instead of wonder-hitting so ladeda and me had to quickly calculate how we could prevent anyone from taking him out. ladeda would spec pump OP while I held half my OP back in order to potentially take Obelisk if anyone did send on Bell. Either all the other attackers were asleep or they were afraid of the ladeda getting Obelisk with it being on low HP. Somehow, Bell got back safely. Bell's actions pissed the entire pack off as everyone else had given up targets in order to attack Obelisk but it turned out ok and he helped kill the wonder when his troops got back.
</p><p>Day 12/50
</p><p>This is around the time our locs got out. Merf had been bragging to me for a while about how he had seen all of our moves before we did them... I kind of doubt it since we had sunk him, snared Tattoo and then obliterated Star Ocean when he suicided. We were in a much better position than them and it was only them having the Obelisk that evened the playing field which is why we took it.
</p><p>8:59:50 AM The Obelisk of Power has been destroyed and rebuilt by Realm #6!
<br />8:59:59 AM We have cancelled diplomatic relations with 666 (# 42).
<br />9:21:23 AM 666 (# 42) has cancelled relations with us.
<br />9:21:37 AM 666 (# 42) has declared WAR on us!
</p><p>Merf also told me that their realm were in better shape than us... not for long:

</p><p>Apparently his realm weren't too happy about him removing Peace against us...
</p><p>Day 13/50
</p><p>NO HITS THIS DAY! This was the first day without anything interesting happening.
</p><p>Day 14/50
</p><p>From this point on, it was all about taking out threats, starting with killing Merf off once and for all:
</p><p>2:59:27 PM Victorious on the battlefield, emo songs making me 4:3 (# 6) conquered 162 land from Night (# 42). (85.1% with War)
</p><p>I'd waited a long time for that one.
</p><p>Day 17/50
</p><p>Thanks to us spending time fighting it out with (#42) for the obelisk, other attackers were able to grow. ladeda and me were now pretty much tied with both (#43) kobbos who had converted early. ladeda had more OP than me at the time and hit Merf all in before Merf raze-sui'd back in order to farm out to ocelot. With ladeda out, both (#43) kobbos thought they were safe and then sent out on trolls leaving themselves open to me. With their ops bitz no longer in range of me, they couldn't get ops on me so most likely, didn't know my incoming OP leading to:
</p><p>12:48:24 AM Victorious on the battlefield, emo songs making me 4:3 (# 6) conquered 192 land from Valerian Steel Up Ur Ass (# 43). (100.9% with Peace)
</p><p>Then later, I hit an attacking troll:

</p><p>Day 18/50
</p><p>Then just a hit for land.
</p><p>3:57:55 PM Victorious on the battlefield, emo songs making me 4:3 (# 6) conquered 145 land from Gugma Gi-Atay (# 14). (76.1% with Peace)
</p><p>It was around this time that ladeda dropped guard to hit ocelot in (#7). He had been pumping suicidal OP but was out of our range slightly. ladeda dropped guard and hit him all in, to strip him from his sui power and put him 2 hits out of range (so he's lose all his OP if he did manage to get in range).
</p><p>Day 19/50
</p><p>We were starting to pull away from the attackers at this point.

</p><p>At this point, I just hit whenever I could:

</p><p>My noob pack then unfortunately made a noob mistake when going after wonders and declared war for Lair on #43 3 hours after #42 had done so it looked like we'd be wonderless for at least a few days.
</p><p>Day 24/50
</p><p>This day was interesting really only because both #43 kobolds bizarrely released all their grunts and converted to explorers so our biggest suicide threats of the time neutralised themselves, meaning I could hit without fear of a suicide. I don't know if they just gave up but I wasn't complaining:
</p><p>12:59:34 PM Victorious on the battlefield, emo songs making me 4:3 (# 6) conquered 206 land from Italia (# 57). (79.2%)
</p><p>Day 26/50
</p><p>Then, as lame and gay as it was, our next biggest competition decided to farm out to us after he had bounced during the day and his 2 packmates had deleted. We assumed they saw my 45k incoming OP and realised they were dead either way. The funny part is that because my initial BS on him when he first sent was so bad, I had no idea that I could hit him until he sent on me so he would have gotten back home safe if he didn't sui-raze:
</p><p>3:48:05 PM Fellow dominion hanging around after 4:3 (# 6) fended off an attack from Never Been (# 17).

<br />3:59:27 PM Victorious on the battlefield, emo songs making me 4:3 (# 6) conquered 224 land from Never Been (# 17). (84.1% with Peace)
</p><p>This episode found its way onto the board. I had planned to hit snare-hit (#39) lyc who was way bigger than the kobbo (and with War) but couldn't pass up such an easy grab, especially on the largest attacker outside of the pack. As expected, the kobbo deleted the next day. It effectively ended the round as he was our last remaining threat although at that point, he was way behind ladeda and me and approximately same landsize as fingal but needing way more DP.
</p><p>Day 27/50
</p><p>With no attackers in range for the first time, I could send pretty freely and 4:3 for the first time:
</p><p>12:52:05 PM Victorious on the battlefield, emo songs making me 4:3 (# 6) conquered 223 land from Cache 22 (# 39). (75.1% with Peace and War)
</p><p>This was great because I sent MTs again and completely forgot to cast Frenzy but managed to break him without it on 4:3. From memory I think he had 210k DP before my temples and I left 140k DP. Top OP outside of our realm was probably 160k or so at the time plus temples so there was no way I could hit if there were attackers in range.
</p><p>Day 29/50
</p><p>At this point, there were still only explorers in range plus Aisha (the converting hummie in (#14)). The only thing keeping me from hitting was the 4:3 rule which kept me short of a bunch of people by under 5k. Instead of going for a huge OP and huge expensive DP, I just simply rezoned most of my incoming acres into Temples. Eventually I managed to outtrain the explorer in 5th place:
</p><p>3:07:26 AM Victorious on the battlefield, emo songs making me 4:3 (# 6) conquered 284 land from Jacks 11th Digit (# 2). (87.6% with Peace)
</p><p>The scary part about this was that (#37) gobbo had hit for enough land to get into my range with enough OP to break me. fingal had assured me he could hit him so I sent and sure enough, fingal took out the gobbo so I would stay only in range of explorers.
</p><p>Day 30/50 
</p><p>ladeda was then a great packy because he wanted a hit but let me hit the FW again so that I could stay way out of range of attackers:
</p><p>3:07:25 AM Victorious on the battlefield, emo songs making me 4:3 (# 6) conquered 240 land from Jacks 11th Digit (# 2).(75.6% with Peace)

</p><p>Day 32/50
</p><p>With us covering top 3 spots and only 2 explorers in range, all I could do was keep pumping 4:3 OP. We had kept War on (#39) since taking their wonder over a week before but figured it would force Sauce (Feces Pieces) to overtrain on DP. It also meant that we could snare at any time and when ladeda asked me how close to breaking him I was, we realised we may as well just do it so we snared a few hours before his Ares ran out:
</p><p>6:06:54 PM Victorious on the battlefield, emo songs making me 4:3 (# 6) conquered 349 land from Feces Pieces (# 39). (84.4% with Peace and War)
</p><p>The fun part about this was that due to me training only 20k Master Thieves at this point, when we were snaring, I had a lower offensive SPA than ladeda and failed a lot more.
</p><p>Prior to the hit, I had just reached 1 million NW as well, but at least I had that for 7 minutes:
</p><p>1 emo songs making me 4:3 6 1,000,390
<br />2 Santa 4:3s muslim kids. 6 845,514
<br />3 hanging around after 4:3 6 836,572
</p><p>ladeda then followed up on Sauce the next day after we kept him snared down and then he never came back into our range. 'First roundWin for FW' apparently thought ladeda was aiming for him so deleted a few hours before. That made him the 6th person to delete/quit because of us.
</p><p>After the hit, it took a full 4 days for anybody outside of the pack to get back into my 75% range so I just stocked plat for that time then continued pumping 4:3 OP.
</p><p>Day 40/50
</p><p>I made my 3rd huge mistake of the round. I had enough to crack Gabriel (gabri3ls debut - hummie explorer in #38) on 4:3 but completely forgot to add docks on my previous hit so I didn't have enough boats. 60 docks all round isn't enough apparently...
</p><p>Day 42/50
</p><p>After 4 days of hardly any logins at all due to the holiday period and my hectic party schedule, I found that there were now a whole bunch of attackers inside my range. All but one of them were trolls and they all kept safe with Ares so I had to hit the remaining non-troll who unfortunately was 1 acre inside range:
</p><p>4:59:24 PM Victorious on the battlefield, emo songs making me 4:3 (# 6) conquered 284 land from Procrastinate now! (# 41). (75.0% with Peace)
</p><p>Troll attackers were the only people that could enter range with their turtle and they still all needed Ares Call up 24/7. We pumped insane Temples, to roughly 33% reduction in order to try to maximise our 4:3 so it was unwise for anyone else to enter range without checking the DPs of people already there. I had gone huge temples as soon as I had no attackers in range. This was because I didn't want to have to train inefficient DP in order to be able to send more OP so temples took care of this problem. It was also funny that if there was a troll explorer in range, they'd need same number of smashers as attackers.
</p><p>Shortly after my troops got home, our realm finally proved how awesome they could be. They took the Wall for us without complaining so that lad, fingal and me wouldn't need to drop guard again. Thanks guys!
</p><p>5:37:31 AM The Great Wall has been destroyed and rebuilt by Realm #6!
</p><p>Day 47/50
</p><p>People were now just refusing to enter my range with anything less than 650k DP (all explorers had over 1 million nw) so I ended up dropping guard to hit one of the wusses sitting 1 acre outside my range:
</p><p>10:59:04 AM Victorious on the battlefield, emo songs making me 4:3 (# 6) conquered 309 land from Jacks 11th Digit (# 2). (74.99636% with Peace)
</p><p>Day 48/50
</p><p>Now it was just a case of BFing explorers to finish on equal land with ladeda and lutz:
</p><p>7:59:49 AM Victorious on the battlefield, emo songs making me 4:3 (# 6) conquered 198 land from Warlord (# 8). (62.3%)
</p><p>7:59:23 PM Victorious on the battlefield, emo songs making me 4:3 (# 6) conquered 182 land from I follow some joke (# 12). (60.2%)
</p><p>Day 50/50
</p><p>ladeda, fingal and me had all landed on same land (8,008 - BOOB, teehee) and people decided to take our same-land-finish as an invitation to send out underdefended in order to poach higher ranks. We had wanted Bell to get as high a place as he could so we decided to do something about it:
</p><p>12:12:34 PM Victorious on the battlefield, emo songs making me 4:3 (# 6) conquered 425 land from Trollin for bootay (# 23). (82.3% with Peace)
<br />12:08:22 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Santa 4:3s muslim kids. (# 6) conquered 379 land from Penrhyndeudraeth (# 14).
<br />12:04:21 PM Victorious on the battlefield, hanging around after 4:3 (# 6) conquered 407 land from le perturbateur de paix (#42).
</p><p>Then as we all know, Ross' randomness d*cks me over once again...
</p><p>1/9/2008 6:46:17 PM An army from Penrhyndeudraeth (# 14) invaded our lands, conquering 681 acres of land! We lost 237 draftees, 0 Slingers, 2647 Defenders, 643 Staff Masters and 3262 Master Thieves during the battle.
</p><p>In order to promote and then 10 minutes later prevent retaliation against LAST MINUTE SUICIDES, Invasion has been DISABLED for the remainder of the round. This will occur every round at A TIME OF GREATEST INCONVENIENCE TO RIO on the last day of the round.
</p><p>The suicide on me hurt a lot more simply due to the source. I could have ruined Macros' round win last round but he didn't deserve that to happen. He's supposed to be a dom friend and we had planned to pack together next round. Whether I should or shouldn't have sent out is irrelevant. He gained nothing from hitting me and took everything so I think I have the right to be bitter regardless of everyone else's opinions. Still, we've spoken since and we both know where we stand so to me the matter is over.

<a name="Fingal.27s_Story" id="Fingal.27s_Story"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Fingal's Story </span></h2>
<p>It all started the round before when Ladeda and I played together and realized playing slow strats just wasn't for us any more. I got fed up with the game and wanted to quit, basically just like any other round.
It was rather late when I finally decided to play this round. Ladeda had talked to Rio and Bell and we agreed to do something fun. So we were four. I wanted to play with Margarita as well so I asked the gang if it was ok and they all agreed.
At first we had Bobbo with us as an ops bitz explorer but he for some reason dropped out so we filled his spot with Dreki who I played with before and knew he had a deep understanding of the game.
</p><p>Alright, so the pack was set. We waited for changes and since no drastic changes came up, and especially cause we knew trolls and nox would be overpowered, we agreed to take the risk and go good. We expected everyone else to go fast evil races and get out of the way of the noxes.
I was set on merfolk or dwarf, but then decided to give dwarf a try, just cause I really sucked last time I played them and playing merfolk on top wasn't fun last time I played it. Dwarf however looked nice to play on top, with all good threats being taken care of early on they really had awesome potential.
</p><p>The plan was to go all or nothing, not hesitating to use mods and specs and just play with balls. On top of that we decided to go with an obvious theme that Rio wasn't too happy with at the start cause he feared suicides. We figured that if we managed to pull it off with THAT theme, we'd be even more awesome than we already were. We also agreed that if we got the chance, we'd go for a tie, no matter who deserved the win the most.
Our realm looked very promising at the start, especially cause I, for the third time, landed with James. James, not many know him, but those who do either love him or fear his fireballs. Every time James landed with me my pack won so I was very happy about that. We had another pinoy pack in there which became obvious when they started a pinoy thread in council. 
</p><p>Since I'm lazy I asked Lad to hook me up with a sim and was ready to go.
<br />My protection was pretty good, I made no major mistakes until I came OOP.
<br />OOP: 5.6k OP, 3.5k DP, 632 acres, 5% temples.
<br />12:03:55 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Santa 4:3s muslim kids. (# 6) conquered 35 land from Bitterness (# 28).
<br />12:06:29 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Santa 4:3s muslim kids. (# 6) conquered 14 land from Bundy (# 16).

<br />6:43:38 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Santa 4:3s muslim kids. (# 6) conquered 10 land from Plant (# 25).
</p><p>Needless to say that my OOP totally sucked balls. I was a sec late on 2 of those grabs (yes, I rechecked their land a sec before I hit) and my big hit got <a href="/wiki/index.php/Scripting" title="Scripting">scripted</a> in the last second. So I was already way behind. 12 hours out I made another hit, once again 3 seconds too late on an obvious farm:
<br />12:03:13 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Santa 4:3s muslim kids. (# 6) conquered 12 land from NdQ Dark Place (# 23)
</p><p>Alright, this was when I fell behind Rio and Lad who both had decent acres OOP.
<br />I laughed a bit at the farming accusations who all based on the fact that a 632 acre dom couldn't have 5.5k OP.&nbsp;:)
</p><p>I then tried to recover by hitting almost every 12 hours, while going slightly less mods that Lad.
</p><p>6:50:54 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Santa 4:3s muslim kids. (# 6) conquered 50 land from Propaganda (# 42).
<br />6:17:17 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Santa 4:3s muslim kids. (# 6) conquered 51 land from Who Switch Off Da Lights! (# 42).
<br />6:56:01 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Santa 4:3s muslim kids. (# 6) conquered 46 land from Thirt33n Thr33333333333s (# 25).
<br />6:59:31 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Santa 4:3s muslim kids. (# 6) conquered 60 land from Krum (# 42).
<br />8:13:20 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Santa 4:3s muslim kids. (# 6) conquered 52 land from Even Dragons Have A God (# 3).

<br />7:11:27 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Santa 4:3s muslim kids. (# 6) conquered 86 land from Woof (# 17).
<br />3:59:20 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Santa 4:3s muslim kids. (# 6) conquered 73 land from I am Prettier Than You&nbsp;: (# 56).
</p><p>All these hits pretty much got me to the top 10/20. That's when our locs came out and Merf tried to screw with us. He then had his liz suicide Rio so we doubled him, then undeclaring peace, we got a wonder and hit the liz all-in with ares call.
<br />Bell came home drunk and instead of hitting wonder, he basically suicided some dom and got yelled at big time. What happened afterwards was a perfect example of WHY we won. NOTHING! Both Jiri and Brax could have hit Bell easily without any chance of retaliation. But nothing happened. We eventually got Obelisk.
</p><p>5:20:04 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Santa 4:3s muslim kids. (# 6) conquered 87 land from Star Ocean (# 42).
<br />8:48:45 PM Santa 4:3s muslim kids. (# 6) has attacked the Obelisk of Power!
<br />8:59:21 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Santa 4:3s muslim kids. (# 6) conquered 95 land from Star Ocean (# 42)
</p><p>That put me into a nice position as we didn't have any good threats. My OP was blown but some liz hit our realm and left really low DP so I could make an unexpected hit that put me into top 5 attackers, I had to hit without ares, but noone realized.
</p><p>9:57:15 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Santa 4:3s muslim kids. (# 6) conquered 116 land from Hitsugaya (# 44).
</p><p>Followed by another normal hit a few days later:
<br />6:49:07 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Santa 4:3s muslim kids. (# 6) conquered 109 land from Crounching Donkey (# 3).
</p><p>Then things got heavy. Merf suied Ladeda, although he could have hit Brax semi-safely, and farmed out to Ocelot. I was there and hit Merf as second and kept the acres.
</p><p>6:42:53 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Santa 4:3s muslim kids. (# 6) conquered 130 land from Night (# 42).
</p><p>Ocelot was pretty much dead, but he had mad temples so we had to take care of him. Lade dropped guard and bf'ed him, I doubled him out of range.
</p><p>8:59:37 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Santa 4:3s muslim kids. (# 6) conquered 114 land from Big Ideas (# 7).
</p><p>From here on I knew we had this in the bag. Merf was taken care of, as well as Jiri and Ocelot. People bashed him on the boards and I had a big laugh. All those big-mouth Merf-bashers did nothing, absolutely nothing, that showed guts.. The typical kind of players that play it all safe and then whine because someone ran away.
</p><p>From then on it was basically chilled out. Although the usual suspects like Mickles bigmouthed of how we sucked and whatnot they were mostly out of range and absolutely unscary themselves. 
</p><p>7:16:58 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Santa 4:3s muslim kids. (# 6) conquered 135 land from Midnight (# 26).
<br />5:58:16 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Santa 4:3s muslim kids. (# 6) conquered 135 land from Few Seconds Left (# 23).
<br />6:53:07 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Santa 4:3s muslim kids. (# 6) conquered 157 land from Videlicet Urbs of Scelest (# 37).
<br />6:34:45 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Santa 4:3s muslim kids. (# 6) conquered 171 land from Eunice is Still Beautiful (# 24).
</p><p>For all those who had doubts if we're gonna make it, the end of all that came when #17 kobbo suied Lad and basically farmed out to us. It was suspicious, but not our fault he did it. We still have no idea who it was, but the land was highly appreciated.
</p><p>4:30:34 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Santa 4:3s muslim kids. (# 6) conquered 211 land from Never Been (# 17)
</p><p>Then #37 warred us to be at least a little mosquito bite, but even that backfired horribly.
</p><p>5:59:56 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Santa 4:3s muslim kids. (# 6) conquered 267 land from 1.618 (# 37).
</p><p>I hit Hanson, while he was either stupid or too lazy to calc while sending really underdefended with war. It was fun. Was gonna hit their darkelf, but he r/r which would have made me bounce as I found out later on. So the gobbo hit was just sweet.
</p><p>From then on it was easy going.
</p><p>5:59:51 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Santa 4:3s muslim kids. (# 6) conquered 211 land from The Dead Sea (# 20).
<br />6:17:58 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Santa 4:3s muslim kids. (# 6) conquered 229 land from Gugma Gi-Atay (# 14).
<br />1:51:09 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Santa 4:3s muslim kids. (# 6)conquered 257 land from Doing it for my Bee (# 2).
</p><p>He had around 50k less DP than everyone else in my range. Allowed me to leave 5k warriors home.
</p><p>8:57:47 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Santa 4:3s muslim kids. (# 6) conquered 268 land from Thirt33n Thr33333333333s (# 25).
</p><p>I left home around 90k OP after he entered my range.
<br />I had sat for ages allowing Bell to grow a bit with crap DP as well as force ever attacker to stay out of Lad's and Rio's range. Then 2 people entered range, both easily breakable. Some of the peeps that didn't read those ops that were sent to them it seems.
</p><p>9:59:09 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Santa 4:3s muslim kids. (# 6) conquered 284 land from The Troll (# 41).
</p><p>This was the time when I finally got up there with Rio and Lad, allowing me to actually tie for the win. Talking about the tie, we sure enjoyed the "fights" that were interpreted into our pack as early as week 2.
</p><p>10:59:36 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Santa 4:3s muslim kids. (# 6) conquered 248 land from Llywel (# 14).
</p><p>Mac had pumped some big OP and would have been able to 4:3 me while farming himself out to the competition. I didn't expect him to be that lame, but I decided to play it safe and not risk the roundwin. So I saw Mickles sending out and decided to bottomfeed him few secs before his troops came back. I never minded Mickles, but I got sick of his attitude and comments this round. It was just annoying to see him return under a boardmulti, just to get flamed to the ground and once it came out it was Mickles, we had the usual puppets praising him again. Plus the fact he at some point mentioned he was bigger than us early on and *just* didn't consider us a threat so that's why we ran. Too bad that was just part of his imagination.
</p><p>From then on I just stuck to bottomfeeding. Safe hits since I still had very nice OP left and noone was able to touch me.
<br />6:50:37 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Santa 4:3s muslim kids. (# 6) conquered 261 land from I Bleed Scarlet and Grey (# 18).
<br />8:59:23 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Santa 4:3s muslim kids. (# 6) conquered 269 land from Frantik Lands (# 12).
</p><p>So that put me on a nice size. 17 more acres since we agreed to go for 8008 acres.

<p>Well, I don't really have anything written, so I'm just gonna wing it based on what I have saved.
</p><p>I had a really kickass sim which was wave 1 with 632 acres, 10% reduction, and 6k OP. Unfortunately, round start date interfered with a lot of logins which forced me to do wave 3 and I only OOPed with 5.6k OP even on the later wave, which still wasn't bad.
</p><p>2:04:10 AM Victorious on the battlefield, hanging around after 4:3 (# 6) conquered 44 land from LOCK (# 18).
<br />2:04:56 AM Victorious on the battlefield, hanging around after 4:3 (# 6) conquered 38 land from LOCK (# 18).
<br />3:03:51 AM Victorious on the battlefield, hanging around after 4:3 (# 6) conquered 33 land from Subtle (# 30).
<br />4:04:18 AM Victorious on the battlefield, hanging around after 4:3 (# 6) conquered 35 land from Hunke Will Kill You (# 13).
<br />5:15:46 AM Sadly, the forces of hanging around after 4:3 (# 6) were beaten back by AidZ (# 43). &lt;- ouch, I went for an inactive with 2500 NW and 250 land but it turned out that he had actually done an explore - I only BSed and surveyed so didn't know he was on higher land until after I bounced
<br />5:18:22 AM Victorious on the battlefield, hanging around after 4:3 (# 6) conquered 10 land from AidZ (# 43). TAKE THAT!
</p><p>If I had my 6k OP, I could have made 5 75% hits, but I think my OOP was good enough already.
</p><p>7:29:41 PM Victorious on the battlefield, hanging around after 4:3 (# 6) conquered 40 land from Beauishkadoo (# 45).
</p><p>10:28:12 AM Victorious on the battlefield, hanging around after 4:3 (# 6) conquered 45 land from Jack Bauer Doesnt Die (# 4).
</p><p>6:35:50 AM Victorious on the battlefield, hanging around after 4:3 (# 6) conquered 67 land from Krum (# 42).
</p><p>8:59:47 PM Victorious on the battlefield, hanging around after 4:3 (# 6) conquered 74 land from 2008 (# 13).
<br />Rio had just smacked 21 lizard a few hours before, and I was planning on doubling. Unfortunately 21 kobbo had big OP and could have hit me. From his training, it looked like he was going to send this hour, so I decided to wait for him on realm page with an invade page open on 21 liz. Luckily for the liz, Kobbo sent with about 3-4 minutes to go which gave me some time to decide who to hit.
At this point, 21 liz, 17 liz, and 13 gobbo all had same DP on rather close landsizes, but 13 (DJ) hadn't been hit yet and was on his way to becoming a threat. Poor DJ had 500 shamans coming in the next hour too.
</p><p>6:50:24 PM Victorious on the battlefield, hanging around after 4:3 (# 6) conquered 72 land from Trollin for bootay (# 23).
</p><p>4:48:56 PM Victorious on the battlefield, hanging around after 4:3 (# 6) conquered 94 land from Woof (# 17).
</p><p>This guy turned out to be every attacker's farm, he just kept sending out after getting hit and re-entering people's ranges on DP that was too low.
</p><p>1:51:05 PM Victorious on the battlefield, hanging around after 4:3 (# 6) conquered 80 land from I am Prettier Than You&nbsp;: (# 56).
</p><p>4:59:42 PM Victorious on the battlefield, hanging around after 4:3 (# 6) conquered 98 land from Kavorka (# 3).
</p><p>5:17:03 AM Victorious on the battlefield, hanging around after 4:3 (# 6) conquered 89 land from Star Ocean (# 42).
<br />2nd hit of our 4 (3) retals for the sui on Rio.
</p><p>Up to this point, I was pretty much just benefitting from Rio's constant top OP while keeping up as efficiently as I could. However, after he got sui'd I knew I had to step it up a bit and give him a bit more support.
</p><p>8:55:59 PM Victorious on the battlefield, hanging around after 4:3 (# 6) conquered 98 land from Star Ocean (# 42).
<br />All-in with ares after Merf unpeaced us.
</p><p>From here, Tattoo (Jiri) pumped sui OP, keeping us home for a while, but eventually I guess he wanted to send or not be hit all-in, so he started training days of shams which killed his pop and him as a threat to us.
<br />Afterwards, Night (Merf) also tried to threaten us again, but our pop was too good for them to really hold us back with 5 point clerics.
</p><p>3:59:47 PM Victorious on the battlefield, hanging around after 4:3 (# 6) conquered 157 land from Night (# 42).
</p><p>All-in without ares
</p><p>12/6/2007 6:28:14 PM Forces from Night (# 42) invaded our lands, but our army drove them back! We lost 44 draftees, 0 Soldiers, 251 Miners, 199 Clerics and 0 Warriors during the battle.
</p><p>I think he failed by about 9% with his full-on sui, which Ocelot got some nice acres from (187 before land gen). This put Ocelot up into Fingal's range, and he had just added some huge temples. However, I realized that I could hit him all-in, so I did so with a BF to keep his sui OP tamer.
</p><p>4:59:53 PM Victorious on the battlefield, hanging around after 4:3 (# 6) conquered 106 land from Big Ideas (# 7).
</p><p>11:58:07 AM Victorious on the battlefield, hanging around after 4:3 (# 6) conquered 159 land from The Troll (# 41).
</p><p>1:57:32 AM Victorious on the battlefield, hanging around after 4:3 (# 6) conquered 223 land from Never Been (# 17).
</p><p>Right here we were going to take CoG from 39 and I was planning on hitting it, so I decided to see if I could BF any good converters to lessen threats for Lutz and I.
</p><p>5:59:26 AM Victorious on the battlefield, hanging around after 4:3 (# 6) conquered 133 land from SihtDaerDoowSresolYlno (# 10).
</p><p>It turned out that this was a good choice, because he prevented me from sending all-out while I was out of EG (could hit me with an r/r to about 96% forest from his full smithy build).
</p><p>Well, that's all I have. Most of my hits were just to keep up with Rio and provide him with support/keep attackers off of him. Most of the attackers were either dealt with by Rio or else just gave up, so I was just there to mop up what was left. I think I only got to 4:3 a few times on explorers, mainly because clerics are only 4 DP for the 4:3 rule. Even after throwing down huge temples we couldn't hit all of the explorers and Morphling survived to the end on his very efficient Kobbo.
</p><p>Very well played by Rio, except for the whole DB suicide thing. And of course the 12 PM sends which were not a good idea for us. Looking in lifetimes, it seems that no one updated Fingal or I so we did get the tie at 8008, and Rio did get himself updated in time so he's not far behind.
</p><p>I really think that James may be the god of Dominion, 3 of his realms have had winners in the last 5 rounds is it? He really kicked ass. Also thanks to Dreki and Marg for ops, unfortunately Dreki had a lot of things go wrong for him culminating in his friend deleting his account as I'm sure all of you IRC goers heard. Bell's antics were fun as usual even if he couldn't get up for the 4th place finish, and thanks to Fingal for making sure no fat attackers or explorers ended up in my range... I mean... for keeping everyone down after we had run and letting us sui - especially that 37 gobbo who had some really crazy OP considering he wasn't in our realm.
</p><p>Also I was really surprised when our realm who bar a few guys (Capo especially) weren't sending on wonders much, basically took the Great Wall down all by themselves, thanks a lot guys.
