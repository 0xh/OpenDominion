</p><p>----------------------------------------------------
</p><p>Round 34 seen through Bure`s eyes:
</p><p>For starters i congatulate DJohnny for the exemplary way he playes and the fairplay he proved, respecting his word and
and trying to finish both at the same land. it all began when my old friends: Vovin, Caisa, Spider, Darklady, Andreea advised, asked and friendly threatened me to try again to finish a round. Thanks to Vovin for premmie. So, listening to their advise i posted the messageboard that i am looking for a pack so DJ and Noz asked me to pack them having two free spots. For the one free spot i tried to convince XP to play with us ...refusing of course. Funny it was when after two days oop i found out that XP in in our pack:)
</p><p>pack: DJ (lyc). me (orc). XP (icer). Noz (darkelf). Caesar (trol). William (halfer) + random pack: Burnt and Gorgh (both lizards)
</p><p>As in last round i played the same rase, orc, and i undertook the same strategy: spec op si elite dp. i went out pretty good oop with 4 hits bringing land every twelve hours.
</p><p>The first part of the round was pretty hard beacause of the Dark Elf of #26 and the lizzie of #38 the two forcing me as well as DJ to train huge defense. After the lizzie killed the Dark Elf and me killed the lizzie, DJ and I woke up having 70k dp and 60k op concerning that max op out of our realm was max 45k. That was our chance of run away.&nbsp;:)
</p><p>More, immediately after we took controle on the OOP, giving DJ the opportunity to take a distance and more using maximum efficiency the OP 4/3 sendable.
</p><p>From here this was very simple: DJ out of range, i keeping most of attackers home, leaving explorers to get in range of DJ for his 4/3 Op. In a few days DJ and I had that much land that we tried to get Burnt to get top 3. This was pretty easy to do knowing that i am home for more than 3 days pomping OP allowing Burnt to give hit after hit.
</p><p>Unfortunately Burnt proved to be selfish and liar trying to ruin the realm's harmony all the time, lying anyone he could.
</p><p>What Burnt didn't know is that a friendship as it is between me and XP isn't just a simple one it is all about respect, honour and honesty which ties us up better than 12 rounds, and when i pick my pack coleagues i pick friends and people that understand what integrity means.
</p><p>As we got to the final of the round Dj and i decided to finish the round on the same size. For this I made some BF`s to get away of Burnt in order not to have some surprises from him.
</p><p>few things i have to mention, besides that it was a roud like any other:
</p><p>1. My best hit was Sasha (orc #26). Sasha knew very well that i got my OP at home following that hour to make top OP and in normal conditions to use it sending out. I didn`t do that so every ending hour i released some DP specs so it appears i made a hit. Sasha saw Networth drop and fell into the trap:), him sending out .. i being home.His first reaction being&nbsp;: "WFT you are home, F8CK OFF! F8CK OFF!"... I guess it is obvious what happened after&nbsp;:D
</p><p>2. Magic Snare&nbsp;!! Who would have thought that this was so effective? lol... having war with #47, we sank the elf ... further on we all contribued to weakening of the icekin there, leaving him 4&nbsp;% wizzard strength, not being capable to give his self magic and without blizzard he was an easy victim.
</p><p>3. in a day top 5 was completed only by #34, never seen it before&nbsp;!!!
</p><p>4. our realm made 80k land&nbsp;!!!
</p><p>-----
</p><p>Special thanks to:
</p><p>DJ- for the fairplay he proved
<br />XP- for the nights and days spent on the internet talking and trying to make a good strategy
<br />Noz- for the ops and conversations
<br />Caesar- for not abandoning his fight, playing troll attacker, --&gt; inpossible to play this round in my oppinion
<br />Burnt- for making this roung having salt and pepper in it&nbsp;:D
<br />Gorgh- For the ops ( i still donno why this guy makes packs with guys like Merf and Burnt- this guy does not have the obscene way to be as canadians have.
<br />Vovin - for the premmie
<br /># 26, 28, 42, 47, 51 and 52 - great enemies
</p><p>-----
</p><p>CONGRATS:
</p><p>To DJ - for the victory!
Congrats to me, too&nbsp;:)

</p><p>Greetings!
</p><p>I guess it is SOP for a roundwinner or in this case roundwinners to make their story so here is mine:
</p><p>Originally before the round started, I was only waiting for some former packies to pick me up and join the pack, but none came even the guys I use to pack with have already chosen someone else. I was a little upset because of this then used it as a motivation to try and make an impact for this round. (I din't blame them-oldpackies though as in the past round with them, i have wasted my slot in the pack after ruining my round due to loss of internet connection ISP problem)
</p><p>So I made a thread looking for interested applicants to join my pack. First to join was Noz, she gave a word of being an active explorer to help for ops-taking. She is the DE-Grenths Grasp.
</p><p>Second is Caesar, i never played with him before and didn't know well about him. He assured me that he will be active and will attack starting OOP. I thought it was good enough to have someone else attacking. He is the TROLL-Catch a Hot One.
</p><p>Third is Kim, He is one of the RL friend who introduced me Dominion. We played since rnd11-rnd19. He Stopped after Ross deleted 90% of the dominions in the cafe we use to hang out. Also he got so hooked with MMORPG like Ragnarok and his dom name RF online. He said he would play explorer/converter then NW-whore. He was the halfer-RISING FORCE. BTW, I also NW-whore since i started until round 18. Only after that, that i realized Land is all that matters when i managed to enter the top 10.
</p><p>Fourth is Bure, I've never played with bure before but i acknowledged him of his decent performance in the past. Another competitive attacker would be great that's what i thought. He is The Orc - Iron Butterfly.
</p><p>Sixth spot went to XP-n00b haha, lol! he promised to play me this round but then during registration he was still hesitating, I looked for a person to fill the last spot and found none. Good thing he did join our pack. He is the Icekin - Uh oh dom.
</p><p>After the changes was posted, I really thought that a runaway Lyc was possible unless suicided early on. I have always wanted to play this race in the past, but it requires a lot of activity to sustain so i always ended up choosing another.
</p><p>-------------------------
</p><p>OOP:
</p><p>LJ - Lorena &amp; John (my girl and me) though XP's Looking for Johnny really made me laugh so hard!!!lol!
</p><p>I came OOP with 613 acres with 4.5K OP and 5.5K DP. I bounced on my first grab, sending like 1.5k on a sylvan. Recalced him and send 1.8k on the 2nd attack-succeeded. With 1.2k OP left, i wasn't able to find a target so I decided to attack later. I gained 34 acres+ 17generated = 51 acres.Good thing is that i followed XPs advice of increasing my homes(while in protection), so even with that crappy gain, my income was steady and ratmens are so cheap so it helped me train garous constantly. I was nowhere near on top, so i never recorded my gains earlier as there were dominions who were 200+ acres ahead of me.
</p><p>With cheap ratmens + conversion, I managed to attack every 12 hours and made my way on the the top.
</p><p>The first realm to WAR us was 21. WHen they saw my OP, they decided to sink me:
</p><p>10:46:11 AM ROCKYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!! (# 21) has declared WAR on us
</p><p>2/12/2007 10:46:22 AM 1 boats have sunk mysteriously while docked.
<br />2/12/2007 10:46:28 AM 0 boats have sunk mysteriously while docked.
<br />2/12/2007 10:47:48 AM 0 boats have sunk mysteriously while docked.
<br />2/12/2007 10:49:42 AM Our wizards have repelled a Clear Sight spell attempt by And Thee Lord Taketh Away (# 21)!
</p><p>They stopped when they realize i had all the boats protected with my docks. We didn't hesitate to declare for mutual after that, and we made a significant gain on that mutual war.
</p><p>At the end of first week:

</p><p>38 Lizzy stayed home and pumped while me and the DE went on attacking. It came to a point where he(Lizzy) could break even the top explorers, the 26 DE, and the rest. He was 1k short of suiciding me at a certain hour i was out. I was relieved when he went after the DE.
</p><p>2/15/2007 6:27:14 AM Forces from Apollo Creed (# 26) invaded our lands, but our army drove them back! We lost 0 draftees, 0 Scavengers, 153 Ratmen, 3 Werewolves and 0 Garous during the battle.
</p><p>The Darkelf Must've caught him opsing and realized that if he razes me, the Lizzy might find me breakable and went on me instead. Good thing right after he bounced on me, the Lizzy send on him. Then Bure hit the Lizzy. That was the end of the both of them.

</p><p>6:16:30 AM Victorious on the battlefield, LJ (# 34) conquered 282 land from Start Slow Finish Fast (# 35).
</p><p>It was 4:3. When i made this grab, it was very crucial as he/she was online and i could only afford to send 100 pts overweight. I send 201k at 151k defense. There was one attacker in range the 51 Nox. Good thing they only got 4 pt elite op against evil.
</p><p>7:59:36 PM Victorious on the battlefield, LJ (# 34) conquered 240 land from Start Slow Finish Fast (# 35).
</p><p>I calculated him at 198k after my temples. I am short of like 4k more defense to meet 4:3 so i started drafting to cover the 4k that i needed; turned out he went inactive and did not cast AC.

</p><p>This was the time when the BRILLIAN Burnt revealed his true color. Me, and Bure are doing well and out of 51 Dwarfs range. Burnt however is left in his range. The Dwarf pumped a good suicidal OP making Burnt unable to move. Me and Noz were stongly against it for the fact that: We could LOSE Obelisk and will cripple us; If mutual Bure will lose prestige on Black ops; Our smaller doms will suffer from 51's attackers especially the Noxes. Xp and the others agreed so I had no choice but declare it having BURNT promise to send on LAIR in case we lose Obelisk. BURNT promise to even send twice 240k raw 120k each. Burnt couldn't control himself. He send just a few minutes after sinking dwarf, didn't even wait for a last minute grab to make some cover for XP who was still out. 51 Did start hitting Obelisk.
</p><p>This time Bure was able to make a grab. I wasn't. Attacking Dominions who are just below my EG are camping already. Still no one entered my range. Also at this point, i can be sunk. So i decided to leave EG, and hit the Lizardfolk in 51 for docks, and extra land gain from WAR and conversion.
</p><p>Your army fights valiantly, and defeats the forces of Abnegation, conquering 324 new acres of land! During the invasion, your troops also discovered 162 acres of land.
</p><p>In addition, your Garous convert some of the enemy into 2781 werewolves to fight for our army!
</p><p>Water: 196
</p><p>I thought of making another Bottomfeed before joining back to EG, then I saw 22 declared Peace. I checked him and found out he would enter my range. I hit him all in then. It was just perfect, i was back to EG when my troops arrived home.
</p><p>4:11:39 AM Victorious on the battlefield, LJ (# 34) conquered 343 land from Silas Stingy (# 22).

</p><p>That Bottomfeed really delayed me a lot. I knew at this point Bure had the advantage over me as his attack was in his EG range.
</p><p>I took my chance of building everything and train.
</p><p>Then again, I got lucky to catch the 42 gnome with AC OFF, I hit him all in at around 465K after my temples:
</p><p>Your army fights valiantly, and defeats the forces of Synaptic Malfunction, conquering 360 new acres of land! During the invasion, your troops also discovered 180 acres of land.
</p><p>There was 1 dominion who could've hit me at this point. #52 TROLL. When i realized he was up for the ranks, and didn't sui on Bure earlier where he could've, so i sent. We also manage to acquire the Armada just an hour after i hit the gnome.

</p><p>We decided to keep the war even we already got Armada from 47. Then I realized about magic Snare lol yeah it just came to me that it would weaken his wizard strength. So I asked everyone around to snare 47 Icer so he won't be able to cast Blizzard. Bingo! I hit him at 510K after my temples. Safe from Trolls 4:3 as well.
</p><p>Then made last 2 lame hits on rio:
</p><p>Your army fights valiantly, and defeats the forces of lyc a virgin, conquering 207 new acres of land! During the invasion, your troops also discovered 103 acres of land
</p><p>Your army fights valiantly, and defeats the forces of lyc a virgin, conquering 196 new acres of land! During the invasion, your troops also discovered 98 acres of land.
</p><p>I looked for someone else on the 2nd, but he was the only one i could hit safely. Sorry again man.
</p><p>Me and Bure decided to TIE for the WIN. We both worked hard for it. Congratulations to you bure, well played for an Orc race!
</p><p>----------
</p><p>The win was made possible because of great teamwork with our pack and realmmates.

<a name="Jboy_tears_up_Burnt" id="Jboy_tears_up_Burnt"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Jboy tears up Burnt </span></h3>
<p>Burnt:
</p><p>You are by far the worst person I have met in dominion since I started in round 11. You are full of lies, and deceit. You are very dominant in the wrong way, manipulative, and greedy.
</p><p>Some Highlights of Burnts attitude:
</p><p>Earlier when 38 was out, Burnt tried to talk to me into semi-suiciding 38. He said it would be ok because if 38 would hit me, he can hit him back and the realm would still gain more land. Very nice burnt!
</p><p>Second, I did not promise to hit Obelisk. I was close to running away. Sending on Obelisk would reset ny EG application. This would take 48 hours and thus, i will not be able to maximize my 4:3.
</p><p>here's Burnt whining. OoP had a very weak power already. I did not know he was target searching already. But he was short so he asked me to leave EG and hit on Obelisk. I said NO. He went frenzy spamming me on msn, threatened me to that he would farm out to 51, i think he mentioned emesel. He thought emesel was in 51. I ignored his threats and went on with my round.
</p><p>After having OoP, and me pumping crazy op, Burnt manage to grow again. WOW there he is again on msn being friendly =) SWEET! that he respect my decision of not sending on OoP. I gave him another chance. Told them in convo that i was willing to share a 3-winners end round. Those who are in the convo can atest to that.
</p><p>later, we helped him sink the dwarf so HE could send and GROW. He gave his word to us that if 51 hits obelisk, he will be more happy helping the realm of taking the LAIR. We also told himbefore declaring the war that me and bure are not helping on the wonder. He was okay with it as long as he could send and grow. He promised me to send 240k raw 120k/wave on wonder.
</p><p>After loosing OoP, the rest started hitting the LAIR. Wow there's burnt - TARGET SEARCHING! He said he couldn't help because of 2 reasons: 26 Orc might raze him, and 42 Gnome might be able to hit him. We checked both, he was very safe against those two dominions. And there he go- he send out on a target! That hit made him the top dominion (i'm not sure- but i rememebr him being the top dom at some point).
</p><p>Do not count how many times Bure covered for you because we both were the only reason you manage to grow on the top. You are hypocrite! Greedy! and Liar! You lack self control! You definitely need to see a psychiatrist and get some treatment.
</p><p>Again, YOU are the WORST DOMINION PLAYER i have ever encountered.
