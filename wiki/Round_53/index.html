<a name="The_story" id="The_story"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> The story </span></h2>
<p>First of all, I'd like to thank my pack, Rio, BigBell, ImperioN, Dreki, and Switch, because it wouldn't have been possible without them. We also had a really kickass realm this round, with everyone either attacking OOP or doing quick conversions. It was quite a sight to see all 10 of us in EG for much of the round.
</p><p>So, before the round started we were trying to decide what sort of strategy we'd use, and Rio decided he'd like to do another fast kobbo. I wasn't sure if I wanted to do something rather slow or be in a fast support type of role, and was flopping back and forth from an atteching gnome to liz to DE while in the back of my head the idea of doing imp set SPUD kept bouncing around, especially since I had a pretty nice sim for it. Finally, with 6 hours to go, I decided that I'd say screw it and go SPUD - at the very least I could raze people. Rio had turned out to, again, not be wholly available for the OOP day and didn't like the idea of just smacking one big target and a few small ones at wave 6/7 like he had last round, so we made up a nice fast converter for him. Switch went orc and everyone else did slow races.
</p><p>I came OOP with 626 acres and 5.1k OP, but unfortunately had no idea about the new scripting rules since I didn't even bother attacking 1500 DP dominions on the early waves. By wave 4 or 5, I knew something was up and just hit 2 targets with 1700-1800 DP. This left me with almost 1.6k OP to spare, and I could not find any targets anywhere close to that, and could barely even find a BF target for that much. I did, though, and had a total of 120 acres gained OOP. Of course, at 10 AM, a FW who apparently overslept (I would have called him a sui multi except for the fact that he's going to finish the round in the top 50) decided that my 4.5k DP made a good target, and I got knocked for 51 acres for a nice total of 69 acres from 5.2k OP. Things were really starting to look good from here. By 36 hours OOP, I had managed to kind of catch up until, ~40 hours OOP, I get hit by Supermario (# 67) who left around 1.2k less DP than I had, but didn't get hit by whoever from Realm 43 had enough OP to break him and was home at that time. Instead I think they hit a much smaller attacker on similar DP.
</p><p>At this point I was pretty pissed off, but Switch was doing quite well and Rio would start kicking ass once he converted, so I just tried to pick back up so I could be of use to them. It was around this time that Realm 30 (turns out the king at the time was one of Mickles's multis) decided to war us and started fireballing and snaring Switch. Being orc with very few BBs and suddenly very few peasies and no ares, he got hit pretty quickly by 43 lyc (deleted for alliance activity). 30 then started FBing Rio. I think I may have been the only one not blackopped besides ImperioN who was sylvan, since I was actually quite a bit smaller than both our gnome (BB) and troll (Dreki). Rio managed to be a noob since he was doing cell phone logins from Whistler and not really able to pay as much attention to the game as he might have been otherwise. He saw that he had extra jobs available, so released drafts to fill those jobs. Unfortunately, he hadn't realized that the reason he had jobs available was from the FBing, and that those drafts were supposed to be unemployed defense for the time being, the result being that he got hit 5 times (all hits coming from alliance members who were later deleted).
</p><p>If I was pissed off before, I was even more so now. All of our fast races had been tanked and I was playing a SPUD that, of all things, was smaller than our troll and gnome attackers. After being hit twice, I realized that I only had two options: I could whore DP specs and GTs and try to pull ahead or go really heavy on DMs. Since realm 75 was a SPUD pack who were doing option A and were well ahead of me, there was no chance of that working for me as well. So, I decided to allow myself to go up to 8k ghouls in order to keep growing while pushing heavy DMs in place of homes and GTs.
</p><p>I don't remember much of what happened after that, beyond the fact that I had passed up my packies as their races took a toll on their speed. However, by the time I got to 1.3k, DPA levels were so out of balance between higher and lower land that my 1.1k packies were making hits with 26k OP while I couldn't find any targets under 35k. I BFed twice to get conversions while pumping up more vamps and ghouls, but even after that I still couldn't hit any 75% targets while leaving safe DP. So, I decided that since I had some full cost barren land and enough vamps to make a hit, I'd make a 75% hit even though I wouldn't leave safe DP. If I did get hit, I wouldn't lose any buildings (except a few homes) and would have some more free progeny DP. Top OP in my range was 47-48k and I sent on 44k or so, but managed to get home safely. However, that hit alone wasn't going to give me the boost I needed, so I decided to send underdefended again, this time leaving only 40k DP. I STILL didn't get hit, somehow, and had about 5k DP incoming to put me on halfway reasonable DP by the time I was home. Our entire pack was just dumbfounded that I got away with this 2nd send, which now put me at 1.9k (top doms were now 2.1k) with much higher DMs and similar specs compared to the 75 SPUDs, so I was in a half-decent position again and started to build my land.
</p><p>Just as an aside, I know I've heard people like escroft who like to play SPUD talk about getting hit in order to drop them into an area with lower DP targets, but they don't seem to realize that this is a desperation move that will give you a very short-term boost that will end up hurting you in the end. Your goal isn't to attack and get knocked back down - that will just slowly overpopulate you. The goal is to keep gaining land and training more vamps/spectres. If you can't make a safe 75% hit, the best option is to BF on a high conversion target. Attempting to get hit is more or less a last ditch attempt to get competitive OP/DP so that you can continue hitting for land and converts; if you're doing it for the entire round then you're not going to get anywhere.
</p><p>By this time, people had begun to realize that there was an alliance between a few of the top realms. Realm 43 and Supermario in 67 were clearly not attacking each other, and it seemed that 66 was in on it too. Then, not 3 hours after I had started to build, Bird Of Paradise (# 62) hit 43 kobbo who had just sent over 56k OP leaving 50k DP. After this, Supermario suicided on 62 and 2 members of 66 also smashed 62, despite the fact that 43 and 67 both had less DP than 62. I think another 66er might have hit 62, but I don't have the hit saved. 43 was up to 51k DP at this point while 62 had 53k. 67 left only 49k.
</p><p>1:59:37 AM Bird Of Paradise (# 62) invaded Eye of the Storm (# 43) and captured 137 land.
5:41:47 AM Supermario (# 67) invaded Bird Of Paradise (# 62) and captured 164 land.
6:07:29 AM Jonesin Johnson (# 66) invaded Bird Of Paradise (# 62) and captured 139 land.
6:24:16 AM Floored Ford (# 66) invaded Bird Of Paradise (# 62) and captured 122 land.
</p><p>Well, this was just my lucky day, because Supermario left low enough DP that I could break him on a full vamp send. Here was my chance to not only lose my full cost barren like I'd been trying for the last 24 hours (after all, who wouldn't notice 67 getting hit) and to hit an alliance tool, but also to get payback for when he hit me OOP. And let's not forget that I would be hitting an over 100% kobbo with high spec DP as UD.
</p><p>7:05:35 AM Victorious on the battlefield, The Flying Potato Monster (# 56) conquered 152 land from Supermario (# 67).
In addition, your army converts some of the enemy casualties into 0 Skeletons, 0 Ghouls and 995 Progeny!
</p><p>I couldn't have been happier. Best of all, I ended up getting hit to a few acres outside of Supermario's range by the time he returned home, so he couldn't even retal. Having gotten those 1k conversions, I was able to hit again from my lower landsize, and before I got home from this hit, Ross acted and suspended 20-30 doms for alliance activity. Of course, 43, 66, and 67 were hit, but also 75 and a number of halfer explorers who had been feeding the top doms of those realms. According to other alliance members and the logs that got out, 62 and 71 were also alliance realms, but 62 had had some sort of falling out with the rest of the alliance, which is why Bird Of Paradise hit 43. Both 71 and 62 escaped the purge due to 62 seeming to be at war with the alliance and 71 being all converters and thus not seeming involved.
</p><p>With all of the top OPs out of the way, I figured I was safe to send, but was in a hurry so I didn't even check the 3 people who would most likely be the new top OP. Ivetza (37 FW) had unfortunately just finished pumping OP specs to grab top OP now that everyone else had been suspended, and was able to hit me. This definitely slowed down my pace and prevented me from becoming one of the top attackers after the suspensions. A day or two after the suspension, a few of the 75 SPUDs and emesel (66 halfer) were unsuspended. 75 probably would have had enough momentum to take the round there, except that they had been using a login script made by Mickles that had sent their login info to him. Apparently 75 had tried to backstab the alliance and take off on their own just before the suspension, so Mickles logged into their doms and deleted 3 of them. The 4th (toothy) hadn't used the script and the 5th (merf) was still suspended.
</p><p>Plat production had continued during the suspension, and I suppose emesel had been about to convert or was mid-convert, because he was suddenly one of the top OPs along with Ivetza and Bones (# 6) who was coming up, having played a high DM strat like I had, though it seemed with the added benefit of not being raped OOP. However, they all decided to be nice to me at this point. Ivetza had just sent on Lair to take it down, and 6 decided to semi-sui him, at which point emesel hit 6. Then when Ivetza got home from LoD, he hit emesel. In one fell swoop, all 3 attackers who would have been a problem for me hit each other, thus giving me a chance to catch back up with them.
</p><p>It was shortly after this that we warred 37 for Lair, and they mutualed us about an hour later. This was one situation of my packies being great, if annoying, since they wouldn't let me send on Lair. We also had 3 of our 4 non-packies sending on it. When they finished it off, I was able to all-in the 37 orc the same hour. They started hitting back at the Lair, since it seemed they wanted to try and propel Ivetza to the top. However, at this point I was in much better position than Ivetza, who had been going overkill on specs in an attempt to keep pushing OP, and that he would basically be dead if we took Lair again. In addition to this, 37 would only take Lair on less than 900k HP since it was so early in the round. They did indeed get it back on 892k HP, but I had been keeping Ivetza from sending since I had Lair and war and had basically just been pumping vamps for the last 2-3 days, and he was mostly dead at this point. Our little guys began sending on Lair almost immediately after we lost it. They were extremely helpful this round, definitely some of the best overall randomers we've ever had. Unfortunately, 62 then declared war on 37. They had a lot of attackers and a lot of OP, so we were forced to knock Lair down to around 550k HP and then coordinate everyone to take it in one go. Rio was away somewhere for the weekend and would have to hit from his cell, so we were going to have the non-pack guys hit, then wait for Rio to send, and then the rest of us take it down.

</p><p>After this I texted Rio to send, but things didn't quite go as planned, since Dreki decided to get an itchy trigger-finger and everyone followed.
</p><p>2:05:21 PM Soria Moria (# 56) has attacked the Lair of the Dragon!
2:05:25 PM Ugly Buttners (# 56) has attacked the Lair of the Dragon!
2:05:28 PM The Manimal (# 56) has attacked the Lair of the Dragon!
2:05:47 PM I-LIKE-TO-KILL-THINGS (# 56) has attacked the Lair of the Dragon!
</p><p>So there the Lair sat on 170k for an excruciatingly long 4 minutes until...
</p><p>2:09:38 PM 13 (# 56) has attacked the Lair of the Dragon!
2:09:44 PM The Flying Potato Monster (# 56) has attacked the Lair of the Dragon!
2:09:44 PM The Lair of the Dragon has been destroyed and rebuilt by Realm #56!
</p><p>Still, a whole realm full-sending on a wonder within 13 minutes is pretty sweet. Without such a great pack and realmies, 62 would have stolen Lair quite easily.
</p><p>During this time Bones had been hitting (and luckily, bouncing a few attacks due to peace also), so he had a bit of a lead on me now. Also, I believe 6's realmies destroyed the ToD around the time that we took Lair for the 2nd time, so it was pretty much down to the 2 of us at this point. For some reason, Bones left himself open to me and I hit him, after which 62 "suicided" me.
</p><p>11:59:23 AM Bird Of Paradise (# 62) invaded The Flying Potato Monster (# 56) and captured 376 land.
</p><p>I call it a suicide, but it was actually a lizmen and reptile only send. I didn't think he would do it since he would get hit back very easily, and be in danger of being all-inned afterwards. But he did anyway. I hit him when I got back home for some nice conversions:
In addition, your army converts some of the enemy casualties into 61 Skeletons, 61 Ghouls and 1923 Progeny!
</p><p>While I was out on 62, Bones sent again without defending me. This time he could 4:3 me back, but if he did he'd get hit a few times. However, he had really started pumping out ghouls so I thought he might go for me with that added DP to keep him safe from others, but then Ivetza sent on around 185k DP. Bones and I both had 200k vamp OP, so Bones smacked him with enough DP to easily defend me while also knocking Ivetza out of my range. This hit put Bones ahead of me, but shortly afterward he hit 47 halfer, again leaving low enough DP that I could hit him. This time he would be able to sui me back without anyone else hitting him, but I hit him anyway, and this was the start of our first hitting war. He had taken a real liking to ghouls so far, pumping up huge amounts of them to make up for all of the progeny he would need to send to hit me back, and I knew that if I limited my ghouls, the population difference would eventually work to my advantage. He did indeed keep pumping ghouls each time, up to having 11k more than I did. However, since I wasn't going as heavily to ghouls as he was, he quickly gained an advantage and I couldn't sustain the sui war for much longer, and I decided that my 2nd retal hit on him would be the last for this set, but did a few more hours of vamps to see if I could get him to train more ghouls. He did 2.3k more ghouls and hit me one last time which I didn't retal.
</p><p>I was now 5.5k acres with 45k peasants and 880 barren land. Bones had 6k acres, 30k peasants, and I think 1200 barren, so I was able to get a pretty big head start on him for OP training. The only people in 75% range were 62 liz who was now pretty safe all-in and a few of the more well-defended explorers. I dropped guard and did 2 BFs for decent conversions and a land lead on Bones, using half cost acres I had leftover from the sui war with Bones to build half of my hit, while keeping enough barren to cover buildings from a hit by him. For some odd reason, 37 warred 6 and started hitting ToD around this time. After losing Lair for the 2nd time, they had taken HCT, so there was no reason to war 6 except to remove the wonder from them.
</p><p>Once 6 lost ToD they went for Portals, and Bones helped on the last send. However, he sent out too much and I was able to 4:3 him. He was fully constructed for this hit, so it really did some damage, whereas I only lost homes and barren land when he retaliated on me. We did another set of hits back and forth, during which I was coming out ahead due to having better military from more training time. Unfortunately, on that 2nd hit I had overslept an hour, which threw off my timing with Portals and our troops returned home from the 2nd hit at the same time.
</p><p>At this point, I had rejoined EG, but Bones had not, and his last hit on me had more or less been a 4:3. It's usually a bad idea to 4:3 while not in guard if you're a runaway, and Bones got spanked hard.
</p><p>5:52:40 PM Melancholy (# 26) invaded Bones (# 6) and captured 837 land.
</p><p>Go Lorian! Anders (54 Dwarf) also hit him, but I think got triple or quadruple tapped in return.
</p><p>After that, the round was over. Bones hit some attacker who had previously been out of range until he lost the 1300-1400 acres, and he had again left himself open to me. Unfortunately, at one point Bones had swapped peace to a different realm, and then changed it back to us. I didn't realize that it had gone active already and bounced that hit. He was nice enough to send underdefended yet again so I had a chance to redeem myself, and I actually succeeded. He was able to 4:3 me back, and I was able to retal while defending his 4:3. This put me at 9k acres with him at 8k. After I had built again I hit 100k peasants for an hour, which I thought was pretty cool.
</p><p>At this point, Bones just started doing small BFs while attempting to defend my 4:3. There were a few times that I could have hit him, but at this point the 62 DE had become a really big threat to my packies, but was a hit outside of my range, so I chose to keep the DE home over hitting Bones again. My OP was growing fast enough that after a few BFs, Bones simply stopped training and BFing and started exploring.
</p><p>Now I had no one except Bones in my range, and he was now exploring on huge SPUD all-in DP. A few hits previous to then, when Bones and I had stopped to build up, I had taken the -20% spy cost tech and trained to 1 SPA. I had also gotten a survey and castle on the 73 halfer who was one of only 3 doms in my range at the time. He already had 20% GT and 11% walls with only 500 DMs, and having such high mods meant that they wouldn't go up much higher after that, which would be very good for blind hitting off of a CS later on. After a number of days of training, I reached 100k vamps, which gave me 560k vamp OP, and I decided it was about time for me to hit again, so I started training DP to allow me to send more of my vamps. When I was able to send 520k OP by the 4:3 rule, which would also defend everyone's 4:3 OP who would be in my 60% range, I had Dreki CS the 73 halfer to see how far off I was. However, when I looked at the CS, I realized that he had had land come in and was now in my 75% range. Giving him 15% walls and 20% GT, he had 530k DP after my temples. I had just trained some more progeny and had some drafts stocked up, so I trained 3 hours worth of ghouls and hit 73 9 hours later.
</p><p>From there I pumped more OP/DP, and started stocking drafts, increasing my 4:3 to 630k. At this point we were going to try and snare Bones so I could hit him all-in as he had 625k aresless. However, Bones might have sensed my intentions since he casted ares while it had 4 hours left. We didn't get another chance to snare Bones because 62 was nice enough to hit into my range with around 640k DP after my temples. I had 15k drafts lying around that I turned into a bunch of ghouls and skeletons, quickly getting my 4:3 up to 660k and hit him. He would have been able to 4:3 me for one hour, but his spies were so horrendous that I don't even think he could get a BS, let alone a good enough one to 4:3 me off of. This was at 5 PM on day 49, so 12 hours later I BFed 73 halfer in order to reach 11k acres and 2 mil NW.
</p><p>Again, thanks so much to my packmates and non-packmates as well! I'd also like to say that I'm quite disappointed in some of the names that came up in those alliance logs. I don't know why ANYONE would want to get a win from cheating, but I've come to realize that some idiots just don't care how they win, as long as they do. As for the others: bobbo and vapro in particular... I thought you guys were better than that.
