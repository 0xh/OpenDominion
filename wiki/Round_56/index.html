<p>Alright, time for my round winning speech I guess.
</p><p>Where should I begin?
</p><p>Last round a few of my all time favorite packmates dragged me into a pack. I guess most of you know the story. Erik and I went full on and died after week 5. It was fun but we got what we deserved cause we didn't run. Of course we didn't know that history would repeat itself the round after, but this time in our favour.
</p><p>I didn't want to play after that round. First of all I had my girlfriend that was really, really pissed with me playing dom. Then I had a hardcore uni course that wouldn't allow me to be all so active during the first 4 weeks. And last but not least, I knew I would be gone for a week, with only cell logins (that killed me last round).
</p><p>Of course, Bond and Erik once again had an offer I couldn't refuse. They got Marius (Noob), Rica (Papura) and Jason (Switch) into the pack. I expected this to be a winner pack, considering I had experienced the careful strats, planning and especially the time those crazy romanians put into a round like this (win in round 43).
</p><p>So pack was set, but what races? Until 12 hours before round started we were set on the usual suspects. Lizard, lycanthrope, kobbo and maybe nox. Rica and Marius were set on HuNo, which I was keen on but couldn't due to my busy schedule.
Then some supersmart fella had the idea to go good. As always evil would be overpowered early on, but with 2 humans and 2 dwarfs we would be powerhouse if no other good races were around or killed off quick. John and Jason went halfer for some superspeed and ops, but that didn't work out as good as Rio in round 46.
</p><p>Either way, Erik and I played dwarf, going the same race and basically same strat, just like every round in the past.
</p><p>Rica and Marius made me a perfect sim, considering I had no nightly logins, making my gf really happy for once. Something like 650 acres, 6.5k op, 3.5k dp with awesome income. I had a very nice OOP and made around 200 acres.
Then #25 made their first mistake. They hit me for a lousy 50 acres, while they could have grabbed much more land from someone else. We figured they'd be fast, but with such a retarded move they'd die off rather quick unless they started to play with brains.
</p><p>At this point we pretty much found out that we had Chet (Curious) and Neo with us, two great peeps I had packed with in round 29. Also an active exploring sylvan (Jill), so there was hardly anything that could be better for us, realm-wise.
</p><p>So oop was done. We all just kept hitting, mainly LDA'lers (caused the first whining by Sauce iirc) with crap dp, staying close to #25 who copped a few suicides, getting to 150 schools and nice techs while #25 was whoring mods and specs. Smart people defend suicides. We defended their 4:3 once we became a possible threat, but their risky attitude cost them the round. No matter what people say. If you're on top, you defend everyone's 4:3 or you die. Period.
</p><p>I didn't keep any records, simply because I never honestly expected to win. After day 16 or so I went to France, for a week as I planned. Turned out to be 10 days cause it was so great. All who think I had multis or farms must be retarded. Playing from the beach in France I logged on when I got an SMS from Bond to hit. I hit and logged off. Apart from the hourly training I had no time or anything to play more than one account. I don't remember much from that time, mainly because I was busy with surfing and drinking. But I am sure the others can fill you in.
</p><p>10 days later I got back into this round. Properly I mean. I was laughing hard at the cheating accusations the usual suspects made. Ivetza whining about cheating, the guy who admitted to have played multi accounts in his round winning speech. Of course some puppets were backing them up, but what could I expect.
</p><p>I was 1-2 hits behind #25 liz on 3200 acres, everyone else had died off at that point and with Burnt's inefficiency and my high cleric count and techs I knew it would just be a matter of time until we catch him. Once I got close to his militairy I just doubled his hits (except the firewalkers with crap dp that he hit, but we weren't going down to his level to accuse him of farming with no evidence), making the situation worse and worse for him. Both Rica and Marius were going strong with their humans and Erik was playing well apart from a few mistakes, such as leaving Ares off after an attack and being hit by Burnt. Jason couldn't keep the pace and converted to an awesome ops bitz, Bond was whoring top op as usual.&nbsp;:)
</p><p>Time was playing on our side, so I wasn't in any hurry. Good doms were either killed off early or too slow to be a threat, except a few woodies that could be trouble later on. We finally took out the only scary woodie at around 5k acres when I hit him, being top strongest good dom out of our realm.
Then I made another huge hit, getting on same size as Burnt and by then we knew it was over. Adding OP and DP I had like 60-80k more at that point, always defending his 4:3 +10k, while he never bothered to defend mine. From then on they just hit after I did, leaving a lot less DP, but I didn't have the op yet to hit him on return.
</p><p>Then I just played it safe, dropped a few specs here and there when I needed and hit Fork for 800 acres. Erik had agreed to pump big op to let me go for a back to back hit so he made sure nothing fishy happened to me while I was out.
</p><p>We had been trying to hit Ivetza all-in, but he lucked out on a few hits. Then we saw him entering away mode and I could JUST hit him, while defending Burnt's 4:3 and huge temples. By that point, or even earlier, he was dead and only playing to screw us over. We figured that hitting him 22.59 hours after his last login would be safe and we did it. 2 minutes before that Ivetza contacted Erik on MSN to brag about his away mode, expecting us to not be ready in time. Needless to say, he got pwned big time before entering away mode and whined, like he did the entire round.
</p><p>After that I hit another FW for around the same acres and I knew I had won. Burnt played out his card way too late and suicided Erik, farming out to half the playerbase afterall.
To be absolutely sure nobody explored a whole heap, and to get to 10k, I hit Slater on the last day for around 750 acres. Zed, the only attacker in range had sent, trying to get third place. So I hit Slater on 565k after temples, leaving 560k dp myself.
</p><p>In this short summary, based solely on my memories I didn't manage to point out the excessive amount of time and brain both Marius and Rica put into this round. Not only their doms and team strats, but also into my dom, with endless strat talks of when to drop GN or specs and who we should focus on next. By far the best strategists I have met in over 45 rounds of Dominion.
Erik was also great help, as he was on par with me or even in front until he git hit by Burnt, but later on jumped back up, scaring people from suiciding our pack.
Bond, Jason, Jill, Chet and Neo were also great help in targetfinding and support in whatever way it was needed. Even when it was just fun talk to pass the time.
</p><p>We agreed to tie if that was possible and I honestly think that by just judging by the time and work put into this round, Marius and Rica would have been the true winners. I can't remember how many times I got SMS saying "dude, hit xxx now, he has xxx dp after your temples" and I either drove home quick or made the hit from cell-phone.
</p><p>I don't wanna bore you more than I need to. I think the round got the pack win it deserved, cause we played well for 7 weeks, while others dominated for a short while with burn-out strats, like Erik and me did last round.
</p><p>Albeit all the whining from #25 and the 4:3 + specs + temples strat Burnt played to slow us down, he was the only real competition after week 2/3 and I owe him respect for staying up there for so long. Converters and other good doms were either too slow or taken care of by our realm and no other fast attacker really stayed in mind, so they probably weren't considered a major threat. I might have forgotten quite a bit, but I was super busy at times so excuse that.
</p><p>Apart from big thanks and congratulations to my entire realm for the win and Erik for third place (he will win a round shortly I am sure) I wanna mention Zed who played a good troll round and #46 who also played well and clean.
</p><p>Solo winning is definitely overrated, you gotta see the realm behind it.
</p><p>Thanks for a great round, I am gonna take a few rounds off and might be back in a while.
</p><p>PS: From now on I shall make a better record of the round, no matter what my intentions are.
