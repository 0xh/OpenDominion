</p><p>Have to start off by saying how good my pack was; sadly, rommel and emesel both kind of quit early on after some setbacks, but the remaining guys pulled together nicely.
</p><p>Special thanks goes to Morty for popping an absolutely legendary sui on burnt, to virchue for being one of the most selfless guys I've played with and to Maverick for being one of the most naturally talented guys I've ever played with, taking a strat that he was handed and executing it to near perfection like he was the one who had come up with it, nice!
</p><p>I'll also more then likely quit, as after 2 personal wins and about 5 packwins there is very little to play for anymore. this combined with a busy job, busy social life, playing a sport and a decidedly annoyed GF probably means I can't play seriously ever again, and I refuse to randomly suck.
</p><p>Much admiration goes to Burnt for playing so well despite being quite insane.

<p>Wacky round.
</p><p>When we put our pack together we were pretty sure that we HAD to win the round or it'd be a failure, rommel, emesel, mav, morty, virchue and myself simply constituted awesomeness (in our own minds at least).
</p><p>Planning started, and so did much, much arguing, where one side of the table argued strongly for evil, and the other side argued strongly for good (due to kobolds being massively overpowered). This went on for about a full week untill finally we made the decision to go evil after days of obsessive simming.
</p><p>Rommel and emesel would go with a goblin with heavy dmines and schools and offensive specs out of the gates, I designed a dark elf strat which Mav and me would be running and Morty and Virchue would be running liz for sui power and support.
</p><p>After a productive prot we all kept up nicely, but in a fairly anonymous way, not pressuring the various top attackers around but getting acres left and right, with a bit of help from Talium who was playing a random, exploring teching dark elf with mad spies.
</p><p>Rommel got hit around 2000 acres and basically quit, Emesel followed. I can't explain how much it sucked having them quit after one fairly minor setback, but quit they did.
</p><p>In the meantime, both Mav and myself were doing nicely, but mav got hit and was forced to keep training swordies longer then he was planning while I went on to SW's, ready to start phasing our swordies.
</p><p>Then sht happened; realm 10 decided that they wanted to have the fountain, and because "they were bored" decided to sink us both despite the fact that we were NO threat to anyone.
</p><p>This forced us into plan B; we both had to release all of our swordies and do a sort of mini convert, switching to all spirit warriors.
</p><p>By the time we were done we had both gotten magical weaponry, so despite falling back to 15th and 25th we felt we were still going to have a good shot at winning the thing, if only the top would slow down a bit.
</p><p>In the meantime, morty seemingly managed to pounce on every suicider in sight and was getting pretty big, this served us well later on.
</p><p>After awhile stuff started slowing down pretty bad, mostly due to Burnt (Sundown #51) being a complete maniac and everyone being deathly afraid of getting semi'd or totally sui'd by him.
</p><p>Burnt proceeded to prod, annoy, insult and threaten me for a few days, and accused us of having no balls. At some point we decided we had taken enough abuse from him, and when he sent out, Morty popped a legendary sui on him, and I followed, effectively ending burnt's round.
</p><p>This we considered was the true tipping point, only the 2 lycs were ahead of us, and we knew they'd never be able to compete vs 8 point adepts and 7 point spirit warriors.
</p><p>So we kept going and then everything locked down, mav started bottomfeeding while I kept pumping more and more OP, allowing for smaller converters (mostly nox) to catch up the the all round attackers.
</p><p>I managed to hit asanka (47 gob) twice before the end of the round and got over 10K, and so did Mav. Morty and Virchue both ran into some bad luck at various stages during the round and didn't manage to get high personal ranks, but were instrumental in the pack victory, Talium finished third in the pack and basically had an epic round after starting so poorly.
</p><p>Despite the fact that people tossed all kinds of veiled insults our way for the way we played it fact remains that a dual 10K finish hasn't been done since round 16; so I like to believe our round WAS special.
</p><p>Thanks to all the guys that played with us, special mention goes to Herc (black magic) and Talium, both of them did everything to help despite having no obligation to do so, having gone random.
</p><p>I hope this story sucked less then the one I put up in round 45&nbsp;;)

</p><p>Pretty average OOP, bounced once.
</p><p>Neck and neck with Mac (due the the exact same strat) until realm 10 warred us for FoY and sunk me instantly right near the end of my final Swordy pump. Was forced to release them all, while I still had a load of them training. At least they only sunk me and not Mac, who was therefore able to dominate.
</p><p>From then I started at 1 hit behind Mac, which was a lead that naturally grew and grew.
</p><p>Got hit by Burnt early on when they lucked out with a nub getting the last hit on LoD from realm 0.
</p><p>The major move of the round was Morty's suicide, which allowed myself and Mac to clean up, at the expense of the main competition. That sui worked perfectly for us so well done Morty.
</p><p>Virchue also 'allowed' himself to be suicided on a couple times by 51, allowing us to grab some more free acres. Thanks Virchue.
</p><p>Hit Burnt a few days later, with HUGE satisfaction.
</p><p>Finally, realised I was never going to hit in my 75% range with my relatively low Peasants and high specs, so I started to bottom feed on the unfortunate. Sorry to all those who I hit (once, twice or three times).
</p><p>Thanks to the remains of my pack (after Rommel and MSL quit early on). Virchue and Morty were great for the often needed spy ops. You all deserve this win as much as any of us.
</p><p>Congrats to Macros on the win.
</p><p>This was my last round of Dom - it's been fun.
</p><p>All the best to everyone.

<br />Well first and foremost a huge thanks to realm and packies. All the packies were huge with help with ops, tracking top OP and great with wonders and war. I didn't think in any way I'd end up 3rd but some timely hits end round turned out great. Had great messages and some wonderful convos with many people. This is by far my best finish and I owe most of the credit to the realm and pack. Without wonders and help I know I wouldn't have done crap.
<br />
<br />I figured quickly that I'd be screwed not being a runaway soon enough and when that didn't happen wasn't expecting a 4500 or so finish but decided to go lots of WWs early and I guess that helped keep me from getting grabbed. Sorry to all those good doms that I made train more DP than needed until the DEs took over, lol. I was going to play dorf before Ross changed at the end, so blame him&nbsp;;) I then switched to run lyc thinking it would be fun early and it was.
<br />
<br />Congrats to 11 DEs and congrats to our realm for largest and strongest all round I think. Was one of the best realms ever in my dominion time. Special thanks to mickles and takao for strat talks to keep me going throughout the round, AW, Ineq and Dom for early round support, wonders and ops and HUGE thanks to Taine once again. I couldn't have done it without you&nbsp;:)
