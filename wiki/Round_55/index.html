</p><p>Here's my review of Round 55. Planning for this round started already two rounds earlier when i was thinking
about an atteching strat with suicidal attacks to lose land and generate alot of researchpoints with multiple
hits on small landsize. Because we had a round with Imp-ruleset i decided to skip it and play the Atteching
strategy at a later point. And in Round 54 i just wanted to try for once a real converter after usually telling
people that it is a good way to play without much risk. And i knew that Atteching would be best under Techrules
anyway. Just by this time this Strategy was already made popular by Talium who played it already in R53 and R54
and also by Takao who played it as Troll in R54.
</p><p>But both of them executed the strategy in a different way then i had in mind as i didn't want to go oop on 333
acres. Off course you have easy targets then but also a huge drawback on the economy. Because of that i went oop
on 515 acres but i found that i was too larget to hit landdefense as the script was kicking in on the first
dominion i wanted to hit. Luckily Rio invaded me only a few minutes after i left protection and suddenly i had
really good landdef targets in range without any script making trouble. When wave 6 left protection i got hit
another time but this was pretty annoying and on 480 acres i was no good target at all with 3k defense. But that
was all defense i trained for some time then and went into full suicidal mode going straight for Magical Weaponry
and shortly after Dark Artistry.
</p><p>Takao went into the round with the same strategy, just he went oop on 333 and had more schools. So in the beginning
he had a huge advantage on his techs while i had tons of Spirit Warriors more then he had. In the end it proved to
be better going for economy over the early techs.
</p><p>So with this "slower" teching i reached MW on day 7, giving me almost 17k offense on my 500-600 acres. This sped up
my RP-generation alot and so techs begun rushing in faster and faster. The shortest average time between two techs
was only 7 hours at one point. So by day 7 i had 7 techs and on day 11 i was at 16 techs. At this point i decided to
stop building schools and starting my "conversion" to a normal growth mode. The main problem for this was going from
no defense (around 5k maybe) to more then 15k defense to stay safe above 600 acres. I managed to get 10k defense on
day 12 but i was still hit alot. But with careful choice of targets a bit earlier i was at maximum prestige at this
point. Also i was lucky on my heroes as i was able to get all classes to level 6+. My Smith was the only class i got
no second time during my 95 Eliteguard hits until the rounds end. If i had known he would be my only one i would have not
risked to send him over level 6.But i was lucky with it and had a Early level 8 Smith with lots of other heroes. Only
with my first alchemist i had no luck as he died on level 5. Later in the round i send heroes above 6 only if i had two
of the class i wanted to send and stopped when one of them died as you can see on my 2 level 9 miners and level 8 healers.
The boni from them surely helped alot, especially the smith who saved millions of plat in the end and also the miner who
counted for 75 dmines for several weeks.
</p><p>I did not pay much attention to the things happening above me but on day 12 there was some major stuff going on. The Dwarf
in #54 and the Goblin in #9 got suspended. After that happened, Realm #5 declared War on us and started Fireballing Slater
(Malady of the Mind) which slowed him a bit.
</p><p>Day 13 i managed to get enough defense to stop invasions on me finally. After this point i got hit not a single time for
the rest of the round, so my growth started on 706 acres that day with 661 prestige and 21 techs. Three days later i
reached 1k acres. But at this time i reached the point when i needed more offense in addition to my defense (i didn't train
a single point of offense since 2 or 3 days oop) and i had no luck with targets so i was without any new landgain for
about 30 hours. With newly trained op my growth continued until i was stuck again only 200 acres larger on day 19. But
i went on hitting on day 20 and this was also the first time i used Adepts on offense. With 35k op and 74k dp things went
good for me.
</p><p>On day 20 we got HCT which i found to be very annoying. It was pretty useless for us (well in the end our two Undeads could
get conversion hits on other undeads with it) and #5 was declaring war on us to gain it with an additional 100 prestige.
</p><p>Only on day 24 i grew slightly more then 300 acres but decided to make a small break then to train up more offense and
defense as i was closing up to some guys with more serious offense. Also news spread that i was growing fast and Sauce
even told other to watch out for me and that they should hit me if possible. Nati was so friendly to forward me that message:
</p><p>&lt;nati&gt; Arrived at: 5/24/2009 2:11:39 AM
&lt;nati&gt; hey mate, you're probably already aware of this but lorian (Supreme #27) is almost in your range so keep an eye out. i'm 10k short of breaking him but you've got him easy if he grows too fast.
&lt;nati&gt; -Lady Laxatives of Shlt da Bed With Snorlax! (# 8)
</p><p>Around this time i also found a Darkelf who i believe to be a Spyaccount for someone as he was training Hundreds of Archmages
on the BS i took (and also lots of spies). In the end i was not able to get a Castle on him with like 20 tries and also
Spooks wasted lots of spies trying to get the Castle. In the end i just assumed 14% walls and hit him for really good land types.
Sarmis who was bored after his All-WW-Lyc failed suicided several times on Factory of Legends and got it for us just before
my land from that Darkelf arrived. Construction was really cheap for me now with all those modifiers (-30% tech, -25% Factory
of Legends, -50% from attacking above 75%, -4% from my Hero).
</p><p>While i was catching up to the top i was also paying more attention what was happening. At this point it looked like Rommel
(Ice Cream #29) was the most dangerous later as he had a very solid build with tons of Dmines and good Castle Improvements.
This Ranking Update from day 31 is showing that i started to come closer. Also Slater was taking more and more lead over the
others.

</p><p>36 Supreme Victory Dark Elf 27 3,244
</p><p>One day later i got my 27th tech and another nice hit brought me into the top 10 overall.
</p><p>7:39:31 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Supreme Victory (# 27) conquered 238 land from YourWorld (# 19).
</p><p>But only a few minutes after sending out on that Lizardfolk there was a thread on the boards accusing me of farming this
Lizard, one of the Sylvans i hit earlier and also platfarming as i was Top 10 overall now both in land and Platthief-Rankings.
Off course more then 90% of my stealing was done earlier in the round when i was much smaller and with Darkartistry and using
a Networth Tracker it was no problem at all to find targets and steal without any outside help. I required even on larger size
only very very little help from my pack. In fact i was doing more ops for them then they did for me i think. Most people also
realized how my strategy works and that it was no problem with the stealing and stuff. I really didn't expect to get defended
in that thread but even Sparticus (who doesn't like me much&nbsp;;) told the newbies that there is nothing fishy about me.
</p><p>During this time i started to become a threat for others. Earlier i was just going for easy hits with relative low offense
and now being in the top 10 i had to train a massive offense to get more targets. Still i was able to hit about once every day
without longer breaks. One hit that was very nice for me was hitting Sauce who was trying earlier to get #29 into hitting me.
</p><p>7:58:35 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Supreme Victory (# 27) conquered 231 land from Shlt da Bed With Snorlax! (# 8).
</p><p>While i came closer to everyone else, Slater was still able to keep a constant distance between him and me growing ahead of
the competition in #5 and #29. At this point no other realms had any importance for the run to the top. Rommel and the rest
of #29 took also advantage of their Portal and sent out while my troops where out (or while Slaters where out earlier). But
they soon realized that it would not be possible for them to outtrain my offense in the long run. It would have been only a
matter of days until i was able to hit Rommel all-in and there was nothing he could do against it. The Lycs in #5 where also
in deep trouble as they had like 20k to 30k less peasants then i had and without turtle i was already close to break them
while defending their 4:3 op.
</p><p>So Rommel decided to suicide someone on day 37 instead of getting hit all in by me later and Fingal was the largest he
could get:
</p><p>1:49:32 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Ice Cream (# 29) conquered 416 land from Ask me about Loom (# 5).
</p><p>As i was Updating my Networth Tracker almost every hour i noticed it already a few minutes after the hit. I could have hit
both of them but i expected no additional hit on Fingal for the moment but Rommel going down.
</p><p>2:02:28 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Supreme Victory (# 27) conquered 431 land from Ice Cream (# 29).
</p><p>Also both Lycs sent to retal on Rommel. So i was lucky to not wait until the hourchange with the hit on him:
</p><p>2:41:05 PM Phat Ho (# 5) invaded Ice Cream (# 29) and captured 366 land.
</p><p>2:44:50 PM Ask me about Loom (# 5) invaded Ice Cream (# 29) and captured 335 land. 
</p><p>People asked me later why i didn't hit Fingal instead of Rommel because i could have done so too. But there have
been several reasons:
First I left much more defense on Rommel then i would leave on one of the Lycs in #5. Second I didn't lose troops
on Rommel. And another reason was Rommel going down now but the lycs not so i could spare them for the moment
to have better targets later in the round after hitting everyone else in range.
</p><p>The rankings changed after this actions too:
</p><p>Malady of the Mind 27 Undead 1,017,150 6,722
Phat Ho 5 Lycanthrope 911,266 6,113
Supreme Victory 27 Dark Elf 964,362 5,969
Ask me about Loom 5 Lycanthrope 898,011 5,774
Temporary Peace 5 Undead 873,878 5,215
Ice Cream 29 Goblin 883,466 5,136
Croc 29 Lizardfolk 874,374 4,952
Vampire Hunter D 41 Sylvan 545,635 4,815
Thriller Bark 29 Goblin 813,572 4,503
Sock of Usury 47 Sylvan 571,350 4,400
</p><p>Two days later i went to hit Fingal who was on 330k defense at this time while i left 390k dp after hitting him.
</p><p>1:59:20 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Supreme Victory (# 27) conquered 458 land from Ask me about Loom (# 5).
</p><p>The hit gave me as usual crap landtypes and in addition it was the first time i lost Spirit Warriors due to their
High Clerics Tower. But 1625 Spirit Warriors and 387 Adepts is a small prize for 687 acres and 66 prestige.
</p><p>Just before i went to hit him again he deleted his dominion.
</p><p>1:31:18 PM Ask me about Loom (# 5) has been abandoned by its ruler.
</p><p>So this will be almost sure victory for Malady now as i expect Phat Ho to delete too. I tried sending one unit at
him for a "recent invasion" to make it impossible for him to delete. In theory that should work but on the other
side Fingal shouldn't be able to delete his dominion 11:30 hours after an invasion too. So for that 1-Unit-fail i
lost 16 prestige and it's unsure if it will do anything good for me. But if i can't hit Phat Ho i will most
probably have no chance of keeping up with Maladys bottomfeeding. Just all those "If'2" became obsolete later when
i was checking Phat Ho before going to sleep. Seeing 5k draftees and 1.5 million plat i checked for ares call which
was not running. With incoming Adepts after hourchange i could hit him already now while leaving 370k defense and
more incoming every hour.
</p><p>5:55:24 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Supreme Victory (# 27) conquered 472 land from Phat Ho (# 5).
</p><p>69 prestige and a brand new Alchemist came along with this hit. Slater was able to follow me on this one, so he
was getting a large amount of new land too.
</p><p>5:57:39 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Malady of the Mind (# 27) conquered 381 land from Phat Ho (# 5).
</p><p>We also found out on this hit that High Clerics Tower kills Spiritwarriors but no Vampires. So in addition to the
600 acres he got almost 2.3k ghosts without any losses.
</p><p>With noone left in Elite Guard range from day 40 on things will be difficult now in competition with Slaters bottomfeeding.
Even Phat Ho entered vacation mode now. But my peasants will be nice and enable me to train really fast. Building the
new 1500 acre took me only about 22 hours and brought me already to 96k peasants before the new homes and Wizard
Guilds arrived.
</p><p>Here's a small look on the training i did the next day:
</p><p>Adepts: 1582 563 463 514 - - - - - - - 4948 54948 (8070)
</p><p>But it is sad that this was the only real action for me this round. After the deletion of Rommel and Fingal while
Gothia entered Vacation Mode there was no attacker left on top on the rest of the round was pure Bottomfeeding on
Explorers. At one point i just went on picking the best defended ones to hit. But Yami managed to escape me when he entered
Guard right in time. He was lucky that i decided to hit Morty (the Undead in #5) all in because of the landtypes and after
this he was in Royal Guard. Would have been an awesome hit, not from landgain but from the opa/dpa involved as yami had
about 112 dpa and i was able to send the required ~670k offense.
</p><p>In the end i was pumping mad Swordsmen and was able to outtrain Slater so heavily, that i could bottomfeed faster then he
could with his Undead (mainly because i was hitting those 550k dp explorers for ages while he much less offense). But i think
Slater has really deserved a win too after his strong appearences during the last rounds and also leading most of Round 55.
So we decided to share the victory and i was skipping my last three attacks. We agreed to explore both to 11015 acres as this
was 1 acre more then Ladeda had in Round 53 and so we both have the largest finish since Round 20.
</p><p>So i thank Spooks, Pasi, Sarmis, Mris and Slater for packing with me this round. As always winning would have been much more difficult without such a good pack as support. Especially Slater who had Top op for some time was a huge help to allow me faster growth.

<a name="Slat3r.27r_story" id="Slat3r.27r_story"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Slat3r'r story </span></h2>
<p>It finally has happened, unlike in past rounds I've not screwed myself over on the way to a roundwin. Before the boring part begins and everyone stops reading I want to get a few shoutouts done:
</p><p>Lorian - Best and most insightful player I have ever played with. And still selfless enough to cut his own win by 5-600 acres to wait for me, tie with him and not have a disappointing 2nd place finish. Nothing but respect for you mate, well played round and well deserved win, congratz on your 3rd.
</p><p>Pasi - No way around thanking you for just sticking with it even when your dom didn't look so great anymore and the opsbitzing in the end. But mostly for being around at the ungodliest of nighttimes for fun dicussions about whatever topics, this game would be a whole lot more boring without you.&nbsp;:-)
</p><p>spooks - I've gotten used to enjoying a short chat with the old man early mornings when I was about to get some sleep during past rounds. Also appreciated your opshelp early in the round, been a pleasure playing with you.
</p><p>Sarmis - Thanks for: a. leaving your UD spot to me - b. helping out with the strat and crunching numbers - c. getting us 2 wonders. Too bad your own strat didn't work out&nbsp;;-)
</p><p>mris - Lots and lots of hits I probably couldn't have made without your ops help, thanks a bunch mate!
</p><p>All the people I BFed on (be it once, twice, 3 or even 4 times) - I'm sorry I chose to play it that way and all of you ended up being punished for just being in my range.
</p><p>That being said I'd like to continue with a summary of the round from my perspective. I hope to keep it short, having kept no journal should help with that; no promises though.
</p><p>The pack was formed late in r54 mostly due to Pasi knowing mris/Sarmis and me having kept contact to Lorian all through the round. Even before changes were announced we were certain that DE and UD would be overpowered, DE more than UD, but UD's strength would unfold earlier than DEs. Sarmis, mris and Lorian were of great help with running lots of numbers, convincing me of those races' strength. I was actually set to play Orc when Sarmis changed his mind to a Lyc shrine/all-WW strat and one UD spot was left untaken. We agreed we couldn't possibly pass on having 2 UDs and since Pasi and I wanted to play same race/strat for sometime I switched to UD.
</p><p>I simmed myself a wave2 UD with 1300 vamps, 130 progs and 940 ghouls on 600a (50 schools). The plan was to train only vamps/ghouls until I hit 20k ghouls, use vamps turtle whenever I needed it and see how good I'd be able to keep up while teching to Magical Weaponry. Magical Weaponry with improved WGs (mini-homes) does not only make UD a lot more efficient, it also provides almost complete immunity to black ops. It turned out I trained my first progeny on day 21 at which point I was still in an awesome spot land-wise, but I'm getting ahead of time.
</p><p>OOP went pretty well, I hit twice leaving enough vamps to be decently safe. I think I was able to 11-hr (hit with the vamps that I left home before I gained acres) 2 or 3 times early on which helped a good deal. I pushed schools to 150 and started rolling in techs. From there on I kept hitting 75% every 12 hours looking to maximize converts whenever possible. Top OP was rather low at early stages allowing me to send decent offense for much longer and be bigger than I had expected.
</p>
<ol><li>5 lycs (Gothia/fingal) were obviously going to be troublesome, though not as much for me, because of being evil. When the NAPed dwarf and gobbo started to take turns pushing up top OP I was first forced to sit for more than 12hrs (one out of not more than 4 or 5 occasions IIRC), skipping on acres as well as converts. I think I squeezed in another EG range hit or two before being forced into BFing for the sake of converts. Dwarf/Gobbo were soon deleted allowing the lycs to feed on good aligned explorers that relied on the dwarf to keep the lycs at bay, as well as push out nothing but offense. I have no memories about how well I was keeping up land-wise, but I never fell behind a lot and kept hitting 50%+ for converts, always defending the lycs 4:3.
</li></ol>
<p>They eventually war'ed and fireballed me, but I started rolling in WGs to be safe from serious damage and the FBs soon ceased. I was 2 techs short of Magical Weaponry at that point. At some point (again my memory of the exact course of events fails me) we "stole" HCT, which #5 had been hitting a lot, from #0 so that they wouldn't be given the ability to raze me and I could still trade hits with them if neccessary. They took it from us shortly after, but I managed to hit bobbo (#47 kobbo) twice before it finally fell, one of the hits being my last 75% hit until the lycs would finally die. This was the only time I didn't completely defend fingal and Gothia, but I could have still hit them back if they went after me. 2.4k progenies off the kobbo seemed worth it to me.
</p><p>HCT fell and I really didn't like to see it in the hands of my main competitors at that point, but that was mostly due to the misunderstanding that I believed they would be able to kill my vamps on defense. If I knew that wasn't the case I would have looked to trade hits with them a lot earlier, they were by far the best convert targets out there. In the meanwhile Rommel's realm had taken PoT and he was going strong with his 6hr-return, running a goblin with good imps. Lorian was also nearing full-teched status and started to prepare for growth, ie. train DP. I kept hitting 50%+ pretty much every 12hrs, with slight pauses to build the fullcost acres here and there. On all of my hits I always left lots of vamps home to defend #5's 4:3, I think my fullsend offense was about equal to what the lycs and Rommel had.
</p><p>The round sailed on smoothly, everyone on top growing at roughly the same pace. I was working towards reaching full 25% WGs and my economy was starting to shine compared to the lycs who were not only less efficient but also had worse imps. Only Rommel had me worried because he sometimes managed to send without defending the lycs (6hrs-return), obviously a great thing if you can save the spec DP and keep your economy up. He soon grew to have respectable OP, about that of the lycs backed up with good imps and a slightly better economy than me. Lorian was beginning to catch up and he was a little worried when I sometimes sent just after the lycs, allowing Rommel to make a hit as well. But basically all top-attackers losing OP allowed me to BF 3 times in a row, while they all got only one hit, so I was gaining more than them, which I felt was worth it. Rommel proceeded to zone in lots of GN pushing his OP to suicidal regions, though I still expected him to train DP at some point.
</p><p>Lorian closed in and eventually grew to around the same size as Rommel, I believe I already had a decent land-lead on the rest at this point. Rommel used his suicidal OP to all-in fingal, giving Lorian, fingal and Gothia free acres. Sadly enough for me I was sleeping at that time and didn't get my share because of guard. The lycs couldn't have been more dead than they were at this stage, with Lorian training insane amounts of OP/DP per hour. My numbers for OP were almost as good, but training progenies really took it's toll on my speed compared to him. After all I wasn't worried though since I had played it overly safe all round, knowing it was only a matter of time until he would come up strong. Time came and we took on #5 lycs: Lorian first all-in'ed fingal, who was out of my range after that and deleted 12hrs after the hit. Gothia tried to safe himself by entering away mode, but with Ares down he was easy prey for us a few hour after fingal was gone.
</p><p>If we didn't already, we had the round locked up right then. I was looking at around 80k peasants at peak (damn 20k specs), Lorian maxed out at 100k, not too shabby for attackers. It was complete bottomfeeding-frenzy afterwards, hitting mostly at the very bottom of my range, while Lorian kept trying to hit as big as possible because he now had losses to face. In retrospect I should have probably looked to hit bigger than 40%, but I thought I might run out of targets in the end. Lorian closed the gap quickly but he had already agreed to tie when I asked him earlier, so it was all good. I feel a little bad for making him wait and skip hits as well as not trying to hit bigger, but we didn't expect to reach 11k anyway.
</p><p>In conclusion, I'm obviously pleased with how this round turned out, double win for the pack with almost 4k acres lead to the next closest, can't really ask for more than that. Most things worked better than expected and I never really fell behind other attackers a lot despite teching to 7 techs. I'm well aware that this round offered nice circumstances for an UD with low early top OP, no strong dwarfs and very few fast attackers in general, but it still took a great amount of dedication and activity. Could have been easier if I discovered the HCT thing earlier, worked out fine nonetheless. Also surprised at how well bottomfeeding and especially building the full cost acres works, I expected that to slow me more.
</p><p>Pasi and I had agreed to post the following in case either of us would do well. So here we go, Sparticus proven wrong:
Posted at: 4/30/2009 4:53:58 AM
<br />Yes, it works that way for every land/building dependent unit. But you really shouldn't tech and build WGs with Undead, that functionality is another cruel joke Ross likes to play on noobs.
<br />-Sparticus
</p>
<dl><dd>-)
</dd></dl>
<p>Anyway, right now I'm just happy it ended the way it did for I can finally return to a somewhere sane sleeping pattern and enjoy the good weather more than I did during the round. See you folks in one of the next rounds.
