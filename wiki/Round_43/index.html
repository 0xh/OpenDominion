<p>Round 43 was won by a <a href="/wiki/index.php/Runaway" title="Runaway">runaway attacker</a> and the very same realm secured top-3. This was the third time that the <a href="/wiki/index.php/Rulesets#Tech_Ruleset" title="Rulesets">tech ruleset</a> was used.
</p>
<a name="Roundwin_Story" id="Roundwin_Story"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline"> Roundwin Story </span></h1>
<p>Here follows the roundwin story as written by Papura.
</p>
<a name="The_beginning" id="The_beginning"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> The beginning </span></h2>
<p>It all started with bond asking me like two months ago if I want to make a comeback to dominion. I was not very sure I want to do it as I've been away for a while and was not up to date with changes and stuff (last round I played was 36). Also, being away felt really good so I was not sure I want to go back to the long nights in front of a computer again. But since we had some good rounds together I finally said I'll do it.
</p><p>At that point, I knew that the pack is going to be fingal, bond, quendi and dj. I never packed with fingal or dj before and I was looking forward to playing with them and see how they play. A couple of days later, bond tells me he talked to n00b and he's going to play as well and I got really excited at that point. Me and n00b played a lot of rounds together so we know each other really well. I told my wife I'm going to play another round and she was OK with it (she really regretted a week after) so all was good.
</p>
<a name="Protection" id="Protection"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Protection </span></h2>
<p>We had a few chats about the races and stuff. n00b really liked sylvan and quendi was set on dorf. Initially I wanted sylvan as well, but when bond told me that if we decide on good he will go halfer, I decided to play merf as I knew we got the ops on spy/wizard races covered. dj got the other dorf and fingal the other sylvan (think he would have liked dorf as well).
</p><p>I did not sim much, got a decent sim (well, that could be argued) from the first try and decided to go with it. It was a wave 1 merf with 570 land, 5.4k op, 2.8k non-draft dp and 10% dp reduction . I went with 1st wave because I noticed in the last rounds I played that a lot of oop attackers prefer wave 2 or 3 because they get slightly better results in their sims so I thought I'll have better luck with targets.
</p><p>Once the round started and we saw all the waves, we realized that there is another pack in the realm. At first I think it was fingal that noticed their daemon theme (I had to google each name to be convinced). We already had an irc channel and after a few short talks on msn, we invited them there. There I learnt their names: james, hermann, dreki and xavier. To be honest, the names did not tell me anything and probably my name didn't tell them anything either&nbsp;:). We spend most of protection talking about what our goals are who's attacking/converting/exploring. Pretty much the stuff that gets done in protection.
</p>
<a name="OOP" id="OOP"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> OOP </span></h2>
<p>Three days later, oop comes and we get into one of the most dangerous parts of the round, where anyone can pretty much hit anyone. I think I made around 180-190 acres in 4 hits (or was it 5?) in 75% and 1 hit in 60%, spread across the first 4 waves. Can't remember what my dp looked like but 12 hours out I made a 75% hit with about 2.6k op after temples with the of that got home from the first wave of attacks. A few hours later I made another 75% hit with about 2.9k op after temples and that pretty much made my day. If I were a later wave, I really doubt I could have done those 2 hits 12 hours out.
</p>
<a name="First_Days" id="First_Days"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> First Days </span></h2>
<p>Before round started I knew that with merf I will go mostly spec op (and a small amount of elites for turtle) and elite dp. It was not as much for the spec training costs as for the spec training time. The cycle was like this:
- hit in 75%
- 3 hours later before hour change train spec op
- after that train elite dp
- when land comes in build smithies in advance and rezone as little as possible (had pretty good facts from protection)
This kept me attacking pretty much every 12 hours for the first days. I think it was day 2 oop when I got a great hero: 'Ko'mak Nutas', a level 0 smith, that in about 2 weeks time got to a level 10 one (after which I did not had the guts to send him on attacks any more&nbsp;:) ).
</p><p>Anyways, I kept attacking every 12 hours and trying to stay on the safe side, not training too much op and not drawing attention. I think a lot of peaces went to #5 and #48 then and I was happy with that. I think it was not until end of day 5 when people started seeing me as a threat (when I hit the #48 darkelf 'Shes my Brother&nbsp;!'). Next day I hit the #34 dorf 'BigBird Gave Me Avian Flu' which was actually the biggest non #4 dominion at the time. Soon after that I hit in #34 again, this time a halfer 'Mickey ...'.
</p><p>At this point it was clear I cannot go unnoticed any more so we decided I should join guards and not wait for wonder hitting any more (all the others in our realm had to stay out of guard to see if we can participate in the wonder lottery). People were already asking who I was, so I sent a few messages in BG to certain people (we have an office in Sofia so I have friends there non dom related that can translate for me&nbsp;:) ). This probably tricked a few people, but not all of them (I know xp figured out pretty soon after that who I was).
</p><p>As far as game play went, the #59 kobos finished converting and looked pretty strong. We were watching them and it looks like we were not the only ones. #48 was also doing that and a darkelf in there hit one of the kobos on one of the very first sends (if not the first). When I was about to make my next hit, I had two big guys to choose from: the other kobo in #59 or the #40 fw. I considered the kobo a bigger threat, for obvious reasons, so I hit him ('Prodigal Goblin'). This was the first time I let the #40 FW get away with it.
</p><p>At this point I was a bit ahead, but just a bit. The big lizard in #48 (burebista) started to keep a closer watch on me and at this point we had to take into account, beside a 4:3 from his side, also a possible raze from one of the darkelfs or from someone outside #48. So the next hits were pretty safe, always having a watch over his op/dp. I think this is where I made my first all in hit however, on one of the gobos in #5 ('Erotic Kangaroo ...').
</p>
<a name="First_problems:_.2348_lizard_and_.2317_gobo" id="First_problems:_.2348_lizard_and_.2317_gobo"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> First problems: #48 lizard and #17 gobo </span></h2>
<p>At this point in the round, the #48 lizard and #17 gobo were after me bad. I was also in a vulnerable spot as in order to keep hitting every 12 hours I built mods so that I can construct and pump at the same time. Therefore, gobo was making temples so he was able to get me on a full send while the lizard was close to a 4:3 on full send. I could still defend the lizard but if I send and gobo hit me, he would have been able to follow. Meanwhile, people noticed they are after me and started not caring about their big op and were sending out for land. So we started our first war of the round. We warred #17 and sunk the gobo while he was partially out on a wonder hit (we needed a partial sinking to be sure I can safely send right that hour). With #17 partially sunk and able to defend #48 for the moment, I hit the #59 kobo a second time a few seconds before he got home, terminating his round on top. A few hours after that, #17 gobo got home but we sunk within seconds again and messed him up good (he even casted race spell and as we found out later, already had a target lined up but we were faster).
</p><p>One of the funny things about this war is that our guys stole most of the gobo mana to so that he can't cast race spell, to make his sendable op as small as possible. The mana stealing scared the s... out of gobo and as soon as he had mana (he spend a lot of ss trying to steal it) he wasted it on AC scared I would all in him.
</p><p>That very same day, a very short time after a big wave of attacks from our realm on lod, it fell to some small guy in #17 hitting it. dj was cursed a lot on that day for not being there to send on wonder&nbsp;:). There was a good part of it though: we already had war on #17.
</p><p>However, all this did not change things much. Lizard was getting close to 4:3 and people were still sending out not caring his or my op. This was especially true on the #40 FW who was catching up on me really fast. I got angry at this as the only reason why I was staying home was because I feared I'll be lamed (raze and 4:3 from different realms). So I decided it is time to talk with the lizard and set things straight. Me and the lizard go back long time and you can imagine his surprise when he found out I'm the big merf. He said he thought about it once, but since I have not played in ages and did not tell him anything before round started, he did not think that was possible. Anyway, after a long talk, we agreed that there will be no out of realm alliance just to keep me home. We would still hit each other if we could but that's it. If you can do it with your realm, then it is fine.
</p><p>#40 FW was out again at that time but I could not hit him this time as the #48 lizard could have 4:3 on me. So I took the safe route and hit another DE in #48 ('I beg to differ'). Maybe I could have found another target but was scared that burebista could use those two DEs to raze me at some point (I know I would have), so I tried as much as possible to kill them.
</p>
<a name="LOD_and_.2340_FW" id="LOD_and_.2340_FW"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> LOD and #40 FW </span></h2>
<p>We were set on getting lair from #17, we already hit a small part of it (so that #48 can't steal it) and we were getting ready for making the final wave when we we saw that #40 FW sent. We just could not let him get away a 3rd time. We did a raw op count but we were about 15k raw short without me sending. However, since the FW was out for 10 more hours at that time, fingal and n00b (they were sylvans) sent a small wave to take those 15k off the lair and we got ready for smashing the lair and FW in 9 hours. Everyone saved ss for draft kill and in 9 hours, everything went as expected: my realmies took lair and I hit the fw. Now, I don't know what was in the FW's head, but he sent again on a BF after getting hit. I did not had the op to hit him at the time, but I was still saving drafts and plat as usual, so 3 hours after I hit him I pumped spec op and was again in a position to hit the fw when my troops got home. Which I surely did and #40 FW was out of the game.
</p>
<a name="r.2Fr_and_the_.2336_kobo" id="r.2Fr_and_the_.2336_kobo"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> r/r and the #36 kobo </span></h2>
<p>Now, we just got lair, had a big land lead, nothing could go wrong, right? Wrong! I just got a call from n00b at 1am and got to my computer just to see the #36 kobo on huge gn/gt/temples incoming. The only good thing about this was that he was not in my EG range and the fact he was in EG was a pretty good indication he did not explore the necessary acres either. The first thought was that we should sink him, since he could have pretty much hit anyone in his range all in. After a long discussion we decided that it is best not to do it though, at least not right then: he had decent spa, had better targets than the guys from our realm that were in his range, ... Biggest problem was that nobody was any threat to him, I only finished constructing the land from FW and my op was still suffering from those two attacks. So I started pumping op at full speed, but it was going to take a while to threaten the kobo in any way. In the meantime the kobo hit the #17 gobo all in (which was not too bad for us) and also got ToB. When he got land in and got in my range I was having decent op but still not good enough for his dp, so it was clear I cannot stop him from hitting a second time. And the target was obvious, the #40 starving FW. Anyway, I was ready to hit the FW myself, if the kobo sent on somebody else, so i was refreshing #36 realm page every second on hr change with everything ready. I saw the nw drop at 59:50, took a bs to make sure he's out and got it first try, pressed invade at 59:57 but he hit the FW so no luck there.
</p><p>One of the things I was considering at the time was to actually hit the FW myself at 59:45 or so. I was so sure the kobo will hit the FW that hour that this trick had a pretty good chance of working. That would have been incredibly fun to see me hitting at 59:45 and kobo at 59:50 (fw would have still be in his range after my hit). Even if that would not have worked, there would have been a hit exchange with the kobo and I don't think that would have ended too bad on my side as once I started pumping my op/dp looked pretty good. Anyways, I did not want to risk that as I knew 12 hours after that the whole thing will stop considering the huge op I had incoming. And when kobo got home from the hit, he checked my op and knew it is over for the moment. A bit later on he released grunts to be safe and that was it.
</p>
<a name=".2348_again" id=".2348_again"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> #48 again </span></h2>
<p>With kobo out of the picture, I hit again one of the #48 DEs ('Shes my Brother&nbsp;!'). A day later, I was close to hitting the #17 gobo all in but could not do it because of #48 lizard 4:3. But soon enough, one of the lizards in #5 got in my range and I was able to hit him all in safely. However, burebista told me he wants to attack the same hour as me. If he would not have told me that, I probably would have sent at 59:00 or something. But knowing it, I tried to attack as close to hr change as possible, and in the end I hit at 59:57, which totally pissed off burebista. So we spent the next 4 days of the round pumping. Burebista was keeping my whole realm home because of his suiciding potential, so n00b decided it is time to do something. He sent out and r/r a lot to forest, to make it as hard as possible for burebista to hit him. Since burebista decided not to hit the first time (easy acres for me), n00b sent out again. The problem this time was that easy targets were getting in my range. One of them was #39 orc, who thought I would all in him, so he sent again on a BF as soon as he got in range. This pretty much decided n00b's fate as burebista hit him and got hit back by me. Now, I normally attack right before hour change, but in this case I have attacked early in the hour. The reason was that I wanted to let #34 fw and #34 dorf plenty of time to calc and hit burebista without fearing me. If the would have done that, burebista would have been history, as pretty much half dominion could have followed (quendi and dj were ready to follow up as well). However, #34 was scared of the sui potential so they let burebista be and sent on smaller targets. I think that was nubish on their side but seems to be pretty much in line with what most of dom players do nowadays, just try to stay out of trouble, thinking somebody else will win it for them. Bure got home safe but no suiciding potential against me so I pumped some more and I hit the #39 orc all in anyways (he got in my range with the land from the BF).
</p><p>From this point on I was pumping to hit burebista all in. I managed to do that 3 days later and got him out of range. A day after that however, he hit quendi and was making it in my range again. We were planing a big gang-bang on him where quendi, dj, n00b and fingal would hit him bad, but unfortunately only quendi was able to hit as the others were not safe. Burebista was still getting in my range even after that though, so in the worst case, I would have hit him all in again. #17 gobo hit him a few minutes before hour change and I could not do it any more. But at this point burebista was pretty much out of the game. Too bad we did not went with the second plan from the begining: quendi hitting right before hr change and me right after would have been totally evil.
</p>
<a name="Smooth_sailing" id="Smooth_sailing"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Smooth sailing </span></h2>
<p>Somewhere along the way there was a war with #5 for lair but to be honest, I don't remember much about it, other than hermann being hit on mutual war for huge acres&nbsp;:). We got lair back a day later, they got lair back like a week later and we left lair to them and went for ToE.
</p><p>At this point we started seriously thinking about the converter threat. we had ops on a lot of people and we pretty much knew what everyone is up to. The biggest threat at that point looked to be #59 human ('Crusader') and he was about to convert. Now, #59 hit dreki, our converting human a couple of times as they saw him a big threat. So I considered returning them the favor and dropped in RG and hit the human. The acres were not big but it was right in the middle of the conversion and that hurts. He was also getting constant swarming and stuff from hermann and james so that slowed hit down a lot.
</p><p>Next victim was an icer in #3 ('Ancient Iceberg'), 3 days later followed by another explorer in #20 I think ('!Aphidoidea!'). Not much history about it, they both jumped in my range not knowing my op so they paid for it.
</p><p>About 4 days later, when none except the #34 fw looked interested in getting in my range a funny thing happens: a halfer in #34 gets in range and is hittable ('Mickey ...'). We thought and we thought and the only possible explanation was that #34 is setting us a trap. We calculated their dorf and he was able to suicide me if I got razed by the FW. However, if we both took lb, he would have been 5 acres outside range. Since we doubted the had the guts to explore those 5 acres (as that would have got him in my range and i would have hit him not the halfer), and as we later on calculated all his plat went into troops (we had cs and bs covering those hours nicely, thanks to james), I hit the halfer, took lb and did not worried about the dorf any more. No idea if it was a trap or not, but as fingal says, me and n00b sometimes overreact and see conspiracies everywhere (especially n00b).
</p><p>That very same day we see nw drops on #48 gobo and on cv we see that both him and the DE are getting into range and they are both hittable. DE had suiciding potential but not enough boats for it, so I left him alone and I hit the gobo all in (who for some strange reason decided to build the land he got in even though he had ops on me and I assume he knew I can break him). This put me ahead by a lot so the first thing I did when my troops got home was I released all spec op.
</p><p>Since it did not look like anyone in interested in getting in my range any more (even though my op really really sucked), I started exchanging GT for rax. With all land build and very few GT left, I got to 75k peasants and started training from there.
</p><p>Next 3 hits were attackers that got in my range by mistake most likely. I have to thank talium for the small land errors in his attack calculator for those hits probably&nbsp;:). First was #34 dorf ('Lord of Avernus') who got in range, and since he had suiciding potential we warred and sunk him before i hit him all in (we also sunk the FW a bit after that). Next it was #36 sylvan ('Heat of the Moment') and last attacker was #14 kobo ('Peppermint').
</p><p>Somewhere in between these hits, there was a war with #16. We missed their human early on when we could have nailed him and now he looked pretty strong. He had good techs, was unsinkable, he was a pretty good threat. So we decided to put pressure on him and declare war so that he can no longer be in my range safely. That way we could have snared him, maybe hit armada (it had big HP though), so he had to take a lot of things into account. We were really close to nail him all in without war, but we waited to much on a mana steal and he casted AC at 10 hours. Anyway, without that war, I doubt we would have had first 3 places for our realm.
</p><p>Right after the war with #16 (which ended in a 12k peasant human) we warred and sunk #6 sylvan. He was top op other than me and looked like he could survive in my range, so we had to stop him. Our sylvans were even keeping him flooded&nbsp;:).
</p><p>Last hit was on a #20 halfer again ('!Aphidoidea!') who did not seem to bother about my range this round. I did not really felt like sending out any more as I thought that we pretty much have 1st, 2nd and 3rd assured that way, but quendi was closing in on me. I told him that if he sends I'll send as well and was really afraid fingal will loose 3rd place in that case. But it all solved nicely in the end, fingal made a 'huge' hit on xp and finished 3rd, about 100 acres or so ahead of #16 human.

<p>There are a lot of things I left out of this story. Some I just forgot about, some I don't remember too well. But the story is already long as it is, so I won't add more to it. Bottom line is we had an awesome realm and great round.
<br />Thank you Quendi, great round and great play, especially after all the things you've been through.
<br />Thank you n00b, greatest monarch ever and the best target finder I saw.
<br />Thank you fingal and bond for putting together this great pack and giving me the chance to play again (my wife hates you guys btw).
<br />Thank you dj for ... , ... I know! Thank you dj for letting me win this round, was really lucky you went inactive or else ...&nbsp;:).
<br />Thanks james and hermann for all the ops, sinking, fbing, draft killing and all the other nice stuff you put the other guys through. They really enjoyed it&nbsp;:).
<br />Thank you xavier for being a great realmie and sorry for all the peaces you had to deal with.
<br />Thank you dreki for bringing these daemons together and still finishing more than decent even after all the hits you took early round.
<br />Thanks to all the guys in #4 (though pragmatis was the only one on irc) for this great round and congrats on being top land and top nw realm.
<br />And special, but really really special thanks to a great family of heros. So, everyone, please give a big hand of applause to the Ko'mak family:
