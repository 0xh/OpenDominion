My pack consisted of me, Scrat(Spooks), Jump and Freeze(Mleduc), Foolish Autobots!(Turbulence), Bombshell Rokks(Atraps) and Speaking Silence(Anders who deleted) We landed with Vjs(Frost Nova) who I didn’t know his identity till half the round already passed =.=
Well, I came out OOP with a wave 1 orc with 556 lands, 5.2k modded OP and 2.7k modded DP. I used all 4 units as to maximize my draftee usage. Well, it was my first time playing orc but I knew had to prestige whore for the first half of the round. 
At OOP, I gained about 140 land from 4 attacks. Not much but it was because I was finding the smallest guys possible to hit just above my 75% range. 
And the whoring continued… and continued. I was under radar from 3, 21 and 48 which was good. Around day 14 or so, we successfully grabbed Obelisk. More prestige  However we lost the obelisk to 21 two days later. 21 used this opportunity to sink me and I had to build an insane amount of docks ~8% This was the time Anders deleted too (got raped by 21 liz and kobbo)  . Day 21, we grabbed the Armada. More prestige  I think that by this time, my prestige was already at 1200.
And then the time came when I realized 48 lyc would suicide 21 liz. 
The hit on 48 lyc was clean. I was really refreshing the page between 48 and 21,checking their suicide op, seeing if lyc sent out. Refreshing the page when u know the hit will most probably give u top spot isnt that surprising. As Dj said, I don’t even know him and I had no contact with tetre(48 liz) before the hit on msn.I didnt even know he was tetre until he change the realm name to 'joo are tetreminated' or something(after the hit) As turb posted earlier, I just asked tetre what was obvious(will the lyc suicide).Its not like his 4:3 build was hard to see. He didnt tell me when or how much OP to send. I was sure of the time from the bs i got from 48 lyc.That hr he had 400 garous coming in.he also trained 2k+ offensive specs when 21 sent out coming in about 6 or 7 hrs later(this spec training confirmed the suicide for me).I calced everything.48 could hit 21 the hr the 400 garous come in or he could have waited till the 2k+ specs came in. And if u were wondering why i was refreshing when the 400 garous came in and didnt wait till the 2k specs came in, i knew 21 would try to do something like sink 48.(they were organised and tried to sink me earlier). If u are still doubtful about the hit, ask yourselves if tetre would have known what time Dj sent.Im sure the attack was carried out when the sinking started.Tetre wouldnt have known the time.
Well… after the hit, I was on par with 21. It was still 2 vs 1 and it didn’t look that good for me. Btw, Burnt, u are one sick person. The msges u sent to me:

Note: I didn’t even say anything to him and he sent all that.
</p><p>He was trying to make me train more dp I think but I could already defend his suicide.
And then my big chance appeared around day 28 or so. (I’m referring to my town criers as I write this so I know what days they are lol) 21 kobbo sent out and I realized it just in time. I spec pumped savages. Released some wizzies too for drafs. 21 kobbo went to sleep before my spec pump so it went unnoticed. The hr came to hit him and I realized he had too many drafs. I didn’t expect him to have so many spies/wizzies to release. I was like few hundred short of breaking him according to my bs. Everytime we (Vjs and I) assassinated some drafs, he released some more. When he couldn’t release anymore, I calced with the bs I got and was like 200 OP short. I just took the chance and made the hit hoping I would succeed and indeed I did. After some calcs, I realized that the bs I got was 99.7% accurate. OMGWTFBBQ! Luck was on my side. I broke him by 300 OP  I think. After the hit, Burnt and 2 others in his realm deleted. His suicide wasn’t enough to break me.
After that, it looked like I was on my way to an easy win but then 11 started to get really strong. Especially with *cough* farming *cough* and lair.
Day 31 we lost armada to realm 20 but then got great wall thanks to Turb, Vjs and another one of my realmies who happened to be online when GW came out. Wall fell pretty fast and I was left wonderless for quite some time. This was the time I really started to pump BBs. I needed the turtle to defend against suicides. 
Around day 36, decided to go for Armada in case anyone tries to sink me. 34 had some pretty big halfling explorers and having 12% docks to protect my boats didn’t seem like a good idea to me. Day 37, made a aresless attack on 37 kobbo.
Day 40 spec pumped and hit a human in 34 after a raze. TheHardCase, that spec pump was actually for the icekin in 48 who r/red to get 60% mountains. The human was safe by like 2k dp and a raze was needed. Every hit I made seems like farming to you. Sheeesh.
After that hit, I was pretty stagnant for a while pumping VMs all the way defending 3 suicides from 11. I couldn’t send for the last days of the round if 11 didn’t send. 2 razes and a suicide would probably have gotten me. But then 11 needed to send or else I would just sat the round out and win. I waited for teresa to send and then I bfed. There were no targets in my range . I just assumed I would lose ~5% of my dp if 11 razed me. 
Last day of the round, I was at 9130 and troll was at 8120 and I thought my win was secure. But then 3 Nox at 7.9k had to send =.= 
I took a risk and hit the nox as I was scared troll would have gotten like 1k acres from her. The 10k acre mark was also very tempting. If 3 and 11 planned to bring me down then, they could. How do u stop 3 suicides from 3 HUGE trolls lol.
Luckily, invasion was disabled a few hrs later and MasterB couldn’t plan my downfall quick enough&nbsp;:P
All in all, was a really fun and time consuming round for me. Only thing im disappointed with is that I didn’t get to 10k acres. (stupid peace)
</p><p><br />
Well, I cant thank my packies and realmies enough. You guys were just great. Spooks, Vjs, Mleduc, who were my main Op Bitzes. Its nice having 3 converting icekins in your realm. Atraps and Turb who stayed until round end to help me with wonders although his round ended early. The wolves pack in my realm, logan smells, bushels, holy undead etc.
Vjs and spooks helped me a lot whenever I had questions on what to build etc. 
And thanks to Raju for getting me the premmie
</p><p>Btw, my dom name this round…Dreams.
I actually was dreaming to win this round as I know I would be uber active&nbsp;:P
