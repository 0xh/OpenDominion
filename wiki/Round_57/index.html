<p>Did I really just win this round? Holy Schmoly! I cannot believe my Rossome luck! First I get a 1-acre finish and now this? Wow!!!
</p><p>So let me tell you guys a story about a Crazy little Critter:
</p><p>I gotta start out by saying that my original intentions for this round was to go solo and convert a gnome just to 4:3 the top dom, but after joining the old pack channel from last round I noticed that Neo and CuriOus were still looking for some packies, so I figured they would be nice to team up with since they are both good players and nice people. We had a 4 pack, which was me, Neo (Viper Secret Service), CuriOus (Annals of the Crusade), and Chets brother (Flashfire). Teh n00b talked me into a gobbo strat that was converting at 2,5k land with 1k DMs. I have always wanted to do a gobbo like that, good call Marius! We ended up getting lucky and landing with a 6-pack, which was Burnt, Morty, Burebista, Jiriky, Devasas, Kenshiro. And on top of that Lieke randomed into our realm. So overpowered! Burnt and Morty were going kobbo as well as Neo, so they were converting early and the rest of the other pack was attacking oop, except Burebista who was unsure if he would convert or not.
</p><p>The round started while I was at my girlfriends place and I could not make a sim, so I offered Dreki a premmie if he were to make me one, he graciously accepted. Do NOT forget I owe you one Dreki. Thanks again. I came oop on 750 land with 190 DMs and ~7k dp. Great sim. Early round it looked like Spart and Vapro were doing quite well, but it seemed like I hardly ever had to train dp so I was just exploring as fast as possible, but I’m sure I could have been faster. After some debating I ended up choosing to stop my DMs at 725 instead of 1k like I had originally planned. Early round Lorian had a lot more speed than I did thanks to his FHs and facts. Burnt and Morty convert and hit by day 7. Then day 8 Kenshiro was deleted for cheating I guess. Oh well.
</p><p>About the time I decided to start converting, Burnt, Morty and Devasas destroyed the CoG and boosted my plat to ~150k plat/hr on day 14. Then #23 decided to war us and black op the poo outta Burnt, FBd him down to 13k peasants and then they took the CoG. I explored to ~2,700 acres for my conversion and started converting on day 15. Some time during my conversion we noticed that korF (#35 kobbo) was looking good, so we decided to war him and try to sink him down and snare him. #35 decided to go mutual war with us. SeRiously? Nice! Day 19 we started snaring korF because Morty and I were going to all-in him when he dropped his spell, but I guess fork thought we were snaring him so that he couldn’t cast his self-spell, so fork casted his spell and ended up hitting Devasas. That made it a lot easier for us, so Morty, myself, and Neo triple Fork. Stick a fork in his arse, he was done. Also, day 20 is when Burnt all-inned Sparticus (#2 Avatar of Woe). Another problem killed.
</p><p>I spent a lot of time driving between my girlfriends place and my place, which was 350 miles are so and took 4.5-5 hours one way. I did this pretty much every weekend until Day 30 when I finally moved over there with her. During one of those drives back to my place Burnt told me to hit the attacking halfer in #24 (A Naughty Puppy), so I did. While, I was driving 80mph down the freeway! I should have pulled over, but I am just crazy. Thankfully it is Montana and there is nobody on the freeway except drunkards. About the time we got rid of Fork and Spart, Slat3r (#17 kobbo, By Demons Be Driven) was starting to convert. He was looking really nasty. He had like 61k peasants left during his conversion and he had the PoT, so we decided to war #17 and steal the PoT and try to sink Slat3r down. Thank goodness that Morty, Burnt and I were all big with nice op to keep Slat3r down. Then it became a waiting game. I waited for him to send and he waited for us, but none of us were sending out. I was getting really frustrated because the round was becoming much better for converters.
</p><p>Finally, Burnt sent out and Slat3r decided to hit Burnt, which was foolish because at that time we had taken the PoT (thanks to Jiriky and Neo) and plus had Slat3r made one safe hit he would probably have better chances of winning than we did. When Slat3r hit Burnt I was working and saw the hit, so I came on irc on my phone and was calcing Slat3r. Talk about nerve racking, I couldn’t break Slat3r but Morty could and he did. Just worked out that Morty killed enough dp that I cleared Slat3r by a few hundred op. My turn! Talk about nerve racking, I hit him from my cellphone without being able to check for a NW drop. I was shaking like crazy (I am glad that even after all of these years dominion is still makes my heart beat faster). Game over for Slat3r, he ended up farming out to the rest of our competition.
</p><p>I think that we could have really ranaway at that point, but after Burnt ate that hit, we slowed down to try to let him catch up and the round really started to stagnate. So we sat for quite some time pumping op, I could probably easily make a couple more hits, but I just sit. Poor Burebista decided to convert and when he finally did he made a grab and then got hit by the #27 gnome (Catalyst of Damnation), Burnt retaled for him. At this point I was going to hit the #4 orc (Jumper, Justapeon), but Burnt thought that I could hit the #27 gnome all-in. So we checked him and sure enough I could. Nice, I got some nice GNs from him.
</p><p>After Slat3r was dealt with, the next problem became Nati (The Slapaho Tribe #17, dorf). She was converting well and was starting to train nice clerics which worried me, since she had nice sui-potential and a huge castle and a very nice strat. So we decided to war #17 again and sink her. We got her boats down enough that I was able to send out safely and I hit the #1 spud without AC, which I would do again a few days later. Haha! I ended up sitting home after that first hit on the spud and training op instead of building all of my land which sucked but it allowed me to keep Lorian home at that time, so that was good because he could become a problem. After those hits on the #1 spud, I built some nice temples because I didn’t want to rezone. When I get back after hitting the spud the second time we decided to war #26 because their Sylvan (Hurrrr!) had trained 7-8k spec op and looked like he could be a problem, but he only had 167 docks and he had released some spies the day before I guess to defend Morty. I am also only ~2k op short of breaking Lorian all-in with AC on and he must have noticed that because he started releasing grunts for draftee dp. That was really funny because I was not going to hit Lorian, even though I wanted to, Burnt needed me to stay home so he could grow and catch up. At this point we are still all 3 doing very well and there is still a slight possibility for a 3-way tie, but we need to win it first.
</p><p>A little later the #23 merf (StubbyPony) came into my range and I all-inned him without AC. I could have hit him with or without AC, but he made it so much easier for me. After that hit, I there were basically no attackers in my range except the #26 sylvan and #4 orc. I was close to all-inning the orc several times if he dropped AC, but he was just too active. Damn! Then Bure sent out again and Lorian dropped peace with us and hit Bure. I could hit Lorian all-in when his troops came back, but only if he dropped AC. So when he came into range I wasted about 100k mana and all of my WS getting a CS and I never did get a rev on him. Turns out he casted AC earlier before he got home.
</p><p>The last 2-3 days have been crazy as you can tell from our TC. Burnt and Morty ended up dropping guard and were going to BF. We were planning a 3-way tie at 8,500 land which was reasonable, but Burnt bounced his hit against Arthryn (#27 Arth of War, WE). Then you guys know the rest. I ended up hitting an icer explorer in #30 that was in my EG that dropped bliz. Thank you so much Lieke for the help! I guess that upset #30 because they declared war on us later that hour. Then, Sauce (#39 Preggerexia, WE) bounced on Burnt and then Burnt was raped royally by pretty much everyone. I was only ~5k op short of breaking Sauce when my troops came back. Burnt had already told me that he was going to sui-raze Sauce and farm out. Which he did, and he ended up taking Sauce down a ton on his dp, I could easily clear Sauce at that point. Then Jiriky ended up sending 4:3 at Sauce as well. Pretty much as soon as my troops came back I sent them all at Sauce. After that Burnt was scripted and Morty and I were still looking good. That hit on Sauce would be my last one as I was going to wait for Morty to tie with me. But on Mortys next send, Tetre ended up hitting him huge! So Morty and Bure decided to retal Tetre when war became active. Then Morty and Tetre exchanged another set of hits on each other. Game over for Morty. No tie. And that is how all went down.
</p><p>Now here is the thanks section:
</p><p>CuriOus – Thanks for all the ops help and the talks on irc. You are a great packie, sorry that you had some troubles with work and changing jobs.
</p><p>Neo – You are also a great guy. I am glad that you figured out the pack just in time to keep us all together still. Stay patient and remember to keep a level head and you will go far in dom!
</p><p>Jiriky – Thank you for all the ops help, and with the wonder. I really enjoyed your company and I am glad to have been in your realm.
</p><p>Burebista – I am glad to have had you around, thanks for helping out with the ops and hitting Tetre so that he stayed outta my range. Congratz on the new baby! Take care of her!
</p><p>Devasas – Where did you go? I miss you buddy!
</p><p>Lieke – I cannot thank you enough for all the ops and the late night talks! I &lt;3 U!!! And I am glad that you came back to dom!
</p><p>Burnt – I am glad that I finally was on your side of the realm. I appreciate all the help and strat talk, you are crazy and you really are one of the great players in Dominion. I have no doubt that you will win a round soon or at least you will always be in the top. I am sorry that you ate so much crap this round with the FBs and snares and then the hit from Slat3r. Sorry the 3-way tie never happened. Thanks a million for razing Sauce there at the end.
</p><p>Morty – Man I am sorry things did not work the way we hoped. I am sad to see what happened with Tetre and I am sad to see that you want to quit dom. I think you should hang in there and do this again and finally take home the win! Good luck!
</p><p>Special Thanks:
Teh n00b – I dedicate this win partially to you for telling me to go with gobbo! I &lt;3 U!
</p><p>Dreki – Thanks for the sim and remember I owe you a premmie!
</p><p>IC – You told me to dedicate this win to you, so there you go&nbsp;;)
</p><p>JP – my gf. I love you! Thanks for the patience!
</p><p>Morty &amp; Burnt – This win is your win too! 3-way tie ftw!!!
</p><p>Realm #36 – Thanks for all of your help I could not have been here without all your help.
