<a name="General_Information" id="General_Information"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline"> General Information </span></h1>
<p>The first win for firewalker and the third exploring win ever, however it was the first of which was done without the support of a 2nd packed explorer running the same strat.
</p>
<a name="Roundwin_story" id="Roundwin_story"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline"> Roundwin story </span></h1>
<p>Wow! I actually did it, became the first explorer to 9k in recorded history (since rd18) while holding off the best player of all time, preventing him from that elusive record setting third victory. A most satisfying round if there ever was one.
</p><p>Pre-round:
I asked Erix if he had room in his pack and I joined with Nati, Violetta, Ronddraai and Gallagher. When I learned that Nati was in the pack I was excited because she’s the biggest ‘good luck’ charm in the game having pack wins in the last two base rounds. Great job girl, you helped make it three in a row, definitely the best all around packie in the game!
</p><p>My strat was simple, improve on my already nasty fw sim but make sure I had enough peasants to use all my plat. Rd52 I teched which saved me 20m plat but slowed me down too much so I decided to go pure speed. On a side note, in this story I reference my rd50 pace and mav’s pace fairly often. The finishes those rounds were 8151, my personal best, and 8890, the all time record, respectively.
</p><p>OOP: I came OOP at 836 acres and 63k income, 8th overall. The initial threat was #31 so we peaced them a few hours in.
</p><p>Day 6:
<br />Concepts of Virtue 55 Goblin 1,236 49,630
<br />Precepts of Valor 55 Goblin 1,232 51,170
<br />Lord Ian 41 Goblin 1,222 54,990

<br />KOBesha 31 Kobold 1,080 58,964
<br />DElilah 31 Dark Elf 1,079 68,967
</p><p>Day 7: Rio, feLYCia (#31) gets tripled by #55 which prompted us to switch peace to them, especially with two very fast gobbos ready to convert. I’m already at 106k income, a 28k lead over Jiriky, Concepts of Virtue (#55), who was at 76k
</p><p>Day 9: Top OP actually shifted back over to #31 to Gothia, aLYCia at 37k. I'm moving pretty steady now, holding the top spot with Lorian right behind me. I've been able to get about 100 DMs built without slowing me down too much. Jiriky and Spart, #55’s gobbos, convert but never make it back to the top.
</p><p>Day 11: Merf, Ideas of Oblivion (#55) made two quick hits to jump into the lead. Lorian and I are in a dead heat for second place. My huge income (156k) offset by his cheap shamans and huge castle. On a side note, the top six strongest doms are all lycs, shaping up to be another rd52.

<br />Surround Sounds 39 Lycanthrope 1,849 178,254
</p><p>Day 13-14: #31 takes OoP which is immediately stolen by #33, #55 takes ToD, #12 takes CoG giving Naturalweed, Bulgargorhamek Mines (#12), a shot to rise against an entirely evil attacker base. Lorian and Sarmis, Hopscotch Valley (#37), both begin converting. Top OP shifts between Merf and Burnt, Surround Sounds (#39).
</p><p>Day 16: #39 takes down Lair and Burnt is able to smash Merf for 204 acres, ending his round. We took ToB from #49 in hopes that Erix and Rond could catch up but they got FB’d to hell and Erix had to unconvert. Props to #49.

</p><p>Day 17: Slater, Your Worst Nightmare (#33), smashes Gothia, aLYCia (#31) for 246, however #31 takes Lair from #39 which allows Gothia to retain top op at 106k. I reach 200k income, a day faster than rd50.
</p><p>Day 20: #39 gets Lair back from #31 and Burnt smashes aLYCia for 287 acres, Your Worst Nightmare (#33) doubles up for 210, knocking #31 out of contention. I finished building DMs and can focus on alchs and homes
</p><p>Day 24:

<br />Hopscotch Valley 37 Goblin 3,190 510,008
</p><p>Day 26: #5 takes OoP from #33, who in turn get GW. My packies take down MoP from #0 in two waves (after it sat at 40k for 12h). Suicidal stagnation is starting to hurt. Whats Happen (#5) is at 227/180, Burnt’s got 208/179 and Slater, the top attacker, has 212/249.
</p><p>Day 28: Slater all-ins Whats Happen for 297, but the gobbo responded with a 2500 spec pump and a huge suicide which fed the rest of the field. I hit 300k income, 2.5 days behind rd50 after pumping to defend Whats Happen. I’m on pace for 8k atm
<br />11:38:29 PM Lord Ian (# 41) invaded Whats Happen (# 5) and captured&nbsp;??? land.
<br />11:38:29 PM Farminion (# 55) invaded Whats Happen (# 5) and captured 254 land.
<br />11:23:54 PM Your Worst Nightmare (# 33) invaded Whats Happen (# 5) and captured 259 land.
<br />10:08:54 PM Surround Sounds (# 39) invaded Whats Happen (# 5) and captured 292 land.
<br />10:02:20 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Whats Happen (# 5) conquered 425 land from Your Worst Nightmare (# 33).
</p><p>Day 31: Three days later, top op hasn’t moved past 240k

</p><p>Day 32-33: #33 takes Lair and becomes a massive runaway threat, #3 takes MoP from us so we declare on #31 for GW. Rio subsequently LBs me a few times
</p><p>Ok here’s the part everyone has been waiting for…
</p><p>Day 34: In an epic failure, Slater hits too close to the hour change which allowed Burnt to suicide in the same tick. I’m not sure why Slater told Burnt when he’d be hitting but even so #39 needed a few seconds to take to OoP anyway. Also, in a round saving move, Devasas, Farminion (#55) suicides Burnt to prevent him from gaining a massive advantage. Regardless, this changed the round and is what gave Lorian the chance for the win (no one was talking about me yet). The best part for me about this was that the only guys with net land gains were 2nd tier attackers. Plus the #2 explorer, another fw, also gets hit so my exploration lead jumped to 1500 acres.
</p><p>2:55:27 PM Im on a boat (# 55) invaded Whats Happen (# 5) and captured 272 land.
<br />1:17:00 PM Bulgargorhamek Mines (# 12) invaded Whats Happen (# 5) and captured 217 land.
<br />1:10:02 PM U don’t wanna get me mad!? (# 12) invaded Whats Happen (# 5) and captured 251 land.
<br />11:27:52 AM Whats Happen (# 5) invaded Farminion (# 55) and captured 454 land.
<br />4:59:38 AM Farminion (# 55) invaded Surround Sounds (# 39) and captured 540 land.
<br />11:06:52 PM Surround Sounds (# 39) invaded Your Worst Nightmare (# 33) and captured 407 land.
<br />11:06:43 PM The Obelisk of Power has been destroyed and rebuilt by Realm #39!
<br />10:59:59 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Your Worst Nightmare (# 33) conquered 327 land from Flame On Baby (# 24).
</p><p>Day 41: Over the next week, only Lorian made a hit which allowed me to fly. I gained a 1k acre lead, which was a satisfying accomplishment. I set my sights on Mav’s record and I found I could break it if I explored 11 out of 12 hours the rest of the round, unlikely but possible. Even without training dp all week and only building GTs I now had top op covered by 130k so I left ares off for a 10-day span

<br />Wizz In My Pants 34 Sylvan 5,000 659,570
<br />hi 5 Goblin 4,994 899,344
</p><p>Day 42-43: A flurry of attacks cut my lead from 1045 to 180, but since I had so much dp, I kept exploring a steady 8 acres/hr. Two unsung moments that I couldn’t have won without can be attributed to vapro and xEnvious. Vapro single-handedly sunk Lorian, who chose to train 10k spies instead of building docks. Had those 10k units been specs instead, he would have won the round. xEnvious’s realm #34, took down both Lair from #33 and OoP from #39 in the same day! Lorian gets ToD which allowed him to hit out of vapro’s range.
<br />9:56:03 AM The Temple of the Damned has been destroyed and rebuilt by Realm #41!
<br />2:09:32 AM The Obelisk of Power has been destroyed and rebuilt by Realm #17!
<br />11:49:53 PM The Obelisk of Power has been destroyed and rebuilt by Realm #34!
<br />7:28:11 AM The Lair of the Dragon has been destroyed and rebuilt by Realm #34!
</p><p>Day 45: The peak of my economy: 492k income, 82k peasants. If you count gem conversion, which I did almost every hour the final 15 days, I was at 509k income. Some gems went to food since I was swarmed 24/7 the final week.
</p><p>Day 46: I think it was this point when I realized that I was the favorite to win the round, I trained 6k specs to make sure I could defend 4:3+spec pumps. Meanwhile the top ops were keeping each other home and running on 30k pez. Lorian was in the best position with 40k lol
</p><p>Day 48: At this point I was already fantasizing about the win after achieving a 1200 acre lead and I let Erix war #40 so that he and Nati could have fun sinking an exposed human. Burnt gets Lair and both he and Lorian make pretty decent grabs which quickly cut that down. I cursed myself for being so stupid when it became clear that Lorian would need to be sunk for me to win. Robbery had been getting so insane and I had outgrown my towers lately that I had no choice but to make all 24 logins each day within a few seconds. This completely killed me physically and I’ve been getting run down and sick as a result. I didn’t bounce many but here’s a few of the guys
<br />4/22/2009 7:00:13 AM Spies from Ent (# 38) were discovered within the vaults! We executed 9 spies.
<br />4/22/2009 9:00:02 PM Spies from Lord Ian (# 41) were discovered within the vaults! We executed 16 spies.
<br />4/24/2009 1:00:41 AM Spies from Rohan (# 38) were discovered within the vaults! We executed 8 spies.
</p><p>Day 49: Lorian left himself with a 40h window to make 3 hits. At this point I figured I’d finish 9k so I didn’t see how I could win the round. Lorian’s 2nd grab wasn’t as big as I thought so I was renewed with anticipation. At this point, I also discovered that his packie, Takao, I play for fun! seRiously (#41) was 12k away from breaking me. I never would have seen it coming.
</p><p>Day 50: Its not too often that a round comes down to the final day. I stayed up all night taking a few naps running through the scenarios. Lorian had pumped 33k worth of specs but he would now need to bf into the top 25 so it would be a close finish. Lorian needed to make a 177 acre grab to beat me and when I saw that he could only muster 139 I was able to breathe the biggest sigh of relief. Its been 21 rounds since we’ve had such a close finish.
</p><p>Closing Comments:
<br />While I can attribute the win to luck, the fact is luck was only a part. Rd50 I explored to 8k with a double runaway and finished third. If this had been a more typical op round I probably would have finished around 8300 and in 2nd or 3rd place. The fact is, training military is such a small portion of the budget it isn’t going to sway an explorer any more than 1k either way.
<br />This round it was I suppose its typical for a winner to say something like ‘This was gonna be my last round win or lose’ so I’ll say something along those lines. I’m retiring from exploring. After 4 exploring titles, 5 top 10s, two top 3s and now a victory and the all time record, its time to prove myself as an attacker.
