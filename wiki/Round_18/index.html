<a name="Roundwin_Story" id="Roundwin_Story"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline"> Roundwin Story </span></h1>
<p>Story written by <b>Unicron</b>.
</p><p>Several people messaged me in game asking for my halfer strat, while others asked me about my round story, so I thought I would write a more detailed "who were you" thread here. Here's the full strat for my round along with final stats - be forewarned, this is probably the most boring and lame strat ever to win a round, and riddled with errors.
</p><p>I came OOP at about 600 land - more than half of which were diamond mines. Not a very fast start at all. I don't have the sim, but honestly, anybody could have done better. Obviously I went explorer, with about 3k dp. Trained master thieves almost all of day 4, and went all spec defense after that until 1500 land. Until 1500 land, I basically explored until I got over 800 diamond mines while maintaining enough homes/rax for full employment, and stealing plat regularly. At 1500 land, I started building only MTs for defense and explored for nothing except masons until 2400 land, at which point I overexplored for homes, took my plat tech, and converted to attacker. For conversion, I rebuilt alchs to masons, and made a mistake by rebuilding rax as homes since they were more efficient with my high keep (I should never have built rax in the first place, should have gone homes all the way, it slowed my down quite a bit). I started conversion when I was about top 60 overall - after converting I'd almost fallen off the top 100 altogether. During this time, Lorian's pack in 238 was mashing just about everyone ahead of me after Aldaris and Blackreign had r/r'd though, so I wasn't so far behind.
</p><p>Attacking after conversion was actually quite difficult. The DPs everyone had were incredibly high, and I couldn't hit at 75%. Despite my inability to hit large targets, I thought getting my pop moving in the right direction was a necessity, so I made a few smaller hits and got myself to 3k acres. From that point on, I basically concentrated on building masons and homes to the point that I could maintain full employment at all times.
</p><p>I should point out at this point that my pack randomly ended up in a realm with toothy's pack, all of whom were just incredible. Any of you out there, novice or expert, would be lucky to get the chance to play with such a skilled and classy pack, I really can't say enough good things about them. Since my pack was pretty decent as well (but clearly not at the level of toothy's pack as was obvious to all), we were the top non-dragon realm and we were stacked with attackers of all sizes. At 3k, they managed to grab the Temple of the Blessed from realm 51, which we held almost the entire round (I say they, because due to problems with the timing of when I entered elite guard, I couldn't participate in the attack). I got overeager and made my first 75% hit using the temple - and promptly got hit by one of the 314 gnomes for my silliness. During that time, 238 got fireballed by the dragons and started to drop like a rock, and stumpy took over the lead. Things at the top were really messy and I couldn't tell what top OP was, so I spent a few days just building tons of troops and waited for things to settle down a bit.
</p><p>After the dust cleared, I basically started hitting dragons like crazy, still building only master thieves defense. At 4k, we lost the temple to realm 51 again and got it back, but shortly thereafter I got hit by of of the gnomes there in retal for sinking him/her and taking the temple back. At about 5k, I stopped building master thieves and went all defender defense when the top players all suddenly lost their OP from r/r'ing. After that, I just kept hitting dragons straight to 9k, while keeping my masons and homes high and maintaining full employment.
</p><p>Could this strat work again in another round? I'm not really sure, but it depends on a number of factors and rule changes. Halfers struggle sometimes with space efficiency in trying to get enough OP, but I was fortunate enough to basically hold the Temple all round, so I don't know how much OP others could manage without it. And getting the temple is a function of how good your entire realm is, which is difficult to control for. Moving barracks to hills this round was a huge boon - it meant a lot less rezoning costs for conquered land. But the biggest question mark with this strat is how dragons are going to be restructured next round. I fully admit that I took full advantage of the reduced casualty thing against them and hit them at every opportunity, as did many of the players that finished high - but with all the complaints from this round, that will likely change. Having said that, I have to say that sometimes the messageboards make it seem like hitting dragons regularly is easy as pie, and nothing could be further from the truth...
</p><p>That's about it for me. I'd love to hear comments about this from everyone...
</p><p>My hits between 6-8k, I'll have to admit, were incredibly lame. I kept grabbing dragons until 6.6k, when all the ones I could hit were no longer in my EG range, so I was hitting about 75%-80% my size of dragons at that time. Then when I did a cs of the big lizzies and saw that they already had like 10 mil plat saved up, I turtled and amassed tons of plat as well for a few days, and came out with a big load of troops. By then, zorkk and kiligamor had both reentered by 75% range again, so I grabbed them three times and got to 8k. Of course, anyone trying to do that now with the new dragon rules would totally get caned, so I wouldn't really recommend it...
</p><p>The last 72 hours though, I did drop down to RG when it became clear I could no longer safely hit within my EG range, so I was grabbing around 66% of my land size at that time. I'm lucky I didn't get suicided on...
</p><p>In all honesty, I was kind of shocked that I caught stumpy, and I really shouldn't have. I have no doubt, like he said, that if he'd dropped to RG as well and bottomfed his way to the top, he would have won the round.
