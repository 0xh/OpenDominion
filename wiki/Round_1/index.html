<a name="Roundwin_Story" id="Roundwin_Story"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline"> Roundwin Story </span></h1>
<p>The first "real" round of Dominion. This one was plagued by server troubles, which was unfortunate, as it probably turned away a goodly number of players. Oh well, such is life. Round 1 saw the introduction of wonders into the game, in a practically indestructible form. Wonders were reparable, so, it was VERY difficult to destroy them. This round, I was Legions of the Lord (#131). We started the round off well by building the Great Wall in the first days. This stood us in good stead for the rest of the round.
</p><p>The start of the round was dominated by the undead race. At least for networth. There were many suiciding dominions who made things difficult for others. I was personally subjected to 4 or 5 significant suicides (plus some others who really had no impact). Fortunately for me, none actually succeeded in breaking me, including three from the #1 ranked (nw) dominion at the time (two different dominions). The Great Wall was helpful there.
</p><p>My dominion rapidly rose through the ranks to become a fixture in the top 5 land dominions, and my realm rose through the ranks as well, firming up in the top 10. I was in the top 5 land when Rippman (Isle of Insanity) decided he wanted a some of my acres. Fortunately for me, he bounced. However, when he hit me, I said I'd hit him back later on. That moment came a week or two later. A suicider (Crakkafat) had just hit me, and Rippman gained over 500 acres from him, putting him WAY ahead of the competition. I built up my offence, increasing it to the point where I could break him. He noticed the force in training, and decided that he didn't really want to lose that many acres, so, he had me razed a couple of times by other people in his realm. I was not amused. As a result, I had a couple of people raze him in retaliation, before attacking him (successfully). He was not amused. Particularly when, 9 hours later, I repeated the performance. This knocked him from WAY ahead, to around 5th place in the rankings, and propelled me ahead to number 1.
</p><p>The next day, I made another attack on a large Dark Elf (Blood De), at that time, the largest DE in the world. He was unimpressed, and razed me with his undying spirit warriors, and threw a fair bit of lightning my direction. He then told me that he was bored with the game, and had been planning to hit the #1 nw dominion (an undead), but that since I had hit him, he was going to destroy my dominion instead. This wasn't exactly an idea that I relished, so I hit him again, to send him below my Royal Guard range. Then, the next largest person in my realm (an undead) decided that since he was now a good target, he'd take a hunk as well. Disaster averted for me, and one angry Dark Elf on the loose. He deleted and no more was heard of him until the next round.
</p><p>About the same time, Master P (remember him?) contacted me and told me that he had a NAP running between several top players, and that if I didn't join, I was going to be grabbed. Some choice huh? Obsession was the name of that NAP, and it caused quite a sensation when it was revealed on the boards. People weren't very happy about the top dominions and realms creating an NAP. However, nothing much was done about it. Not much came of it anyway, and eventually, it simply broke apart, as the top dominions were starved for targets, and needed to hit each other.
</p><p>At this point, I was ahead of the game, but had not much army for my land. So, I sat around for a bit, and built my acres, and trained military. Others took the opportunity to catch up. By the time I was ready to go, Rippman had again taken the lead, and I was ranked about 5th. I hit Rippman. He was most unimpressed.
</p><p>The other dominions around the top (in land) at that point included Macros (Terror), Angel (Ravenloft), Vortex (Hordes of Smashers), Pella (Pella), Kancer (Anduin), Stretch (Big Balls), Tolstorm (The Jihad), Jedi (Jedi Knight), Aye Cue (Flaming Tumbleweeds), plikt (Novo Milagre) and Chalk (Mi Casa es Tu Casa).
</p><p>We played the grabbing game for a while, and not much excitement happened. At one point, I hit Pella for a goodly amount, which rather annoyed him. He started building up his offence for revenge, but was thwarted by the royal guard. Macros hit someone else in his realm, so Pella used the offence he'd been building, and suicided on Macros. This slowed Macros down somewhat, as the attack was successful.
</p><p>Jedi Knight attacked Chalk, and made a very large grab indeed. Chalk decided to get revenge on Jedi, and built up a VERY large offence indeed. Eventually, he attacked Jedi (for many acres), and I grabbed him. So did Jedi. Jedi was at this point (rightly) wary of
me, and my designs on his land (hehe), and was building a very respectable defence. Chalk got back into Jedi's RG range, and razed him. This time, I thought I could break Jedi, so I tried. However, I bounced. I was mystified. Anyway, I got back to training offence, for another attempt. When Chalk again hit Jedi, I was SURE I could break, so, I sent my army, and bounced. I was somewhat perplexed by this, so I redid all my calculations, and found that I ought to have broken him. Then, I re-surveyed, and found that he had built Guard Towers. I had previously looked, and seen that he had none, so I'd assumed he still had none. More fool me. I lost 20,000 cavalry for that little error. Third time was a charm though, and I finally hit him. He (probably understandably) was rather annoyed, and suicided on me, and then deleted.
</p><p>Many people disliked Angel in Round 1, for what were thought to be dishonourable tactics. Basically, she farmed her realm, and her friends, without ever exposing herself. This worked very successfully, as she managed to get, and hold, the number 1 networth position until the very end of the round. There were many accusations of cheating, but none were proved, and she wasn't deleted. In any case, no one managed to do anything about her, so she finished up the round ranked second for networth, and third for land (goes to show, the best tactics are not necessarily the most popular).
</p><p>Other events of interest included the destruction by Ruthless Regent (Specialist) and his realm of the Obelisk of Power.
</p><p>My realm eventually finished the round in #1 position (for land) just ahead of Macros' realm. Congratulations go to Quail Hollow, Realm of Retribution, Toyota Nizmo VTEC, Nissan Mugen, Nissan Mugen VVT-i and Transylvania for their performances that made us the top realm.
