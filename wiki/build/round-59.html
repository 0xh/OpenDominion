However, it was agreed that the tech ruleset is too unbalanced and since the holiday season was fast approaching, it was decided to let this be an imp round, and work on the necessary tech round changes at a later point. Registration opened on 13th of December, 2009.

<p>Well, you will have to forgive my ability to not save dates when I am playing, but I can’t be bothered. Our pack consisted of myself (Fig Newton) Emesel (Archimedes) Rommel (Einstein) Internetfett (Eratosthenes) and Charlie (Confucius) The original plan for both myself and Emesel was to come out OOP with purely Hobgob and some Raider OP to make one big hit, and then follow it up and continue to run this strat until we hit about 3k raiders, and 7k hobgobs (give or take) I ended up coming oop with 679 acres, about 300 raiders, 600 hobgobs, and 1800 shams. I had no mod buildings, and had no intention of doing so until about day 40. The first few days after protection went by rather quickly. There were not many attackers out there as 6 was converting, along with every kobbo. Our main concern for the first half of the round or so was pretty much just the FW in 8.
</p><p>My first big hit came around day 9 when one of the spuds in 6 sent out on enough DP to defend Emesel, but I can only assume never checked out my OP. I broke him and was easily defended, and took about 160 acres at a very early stage of the game. It was probably the first turning point, as it enabled me to protect Emesel for a while after he was hit by Apocalypse in 14. A few days later, one of the first mini-wars broke out, and it involved the kobbo in 26 randomly sending out and basically ended up farming out to the guys in 8, and Rio who also got a shot in. I wasn’t home at the time, so I missed out on the acres. Later, Apocalypse ended up hitting Rio, and would have been able to defend myself and Emesel pretty easily. With that in mind, we decided that Cody would raze him for Emesel, and we ended up taking the gobo out. I later got a small hit when the Kobbo suicided on Rio. At that point, it was really a two-realm fight between our realm, and #8. The Orc in 14 had also built up to some pretty impressive offense, but we just declared war and sunk him down about a third of his op, basically ending his round.
</p><p>Everything was pretty much going our way, as the FW in 8 was constantly keeping Bure (who rose up pretty fast to challenge us) from sending. Then, somewhat inexplicably, the FW in 8 decided to hit a halfer without frenzy for the second time in a few days on the HC , and was crushed by Bure which really changed the whole round because he could not retal. On top of that, The Orc in 11 had built up enough OP to keep both myself and Emesel home, but the only issue was that he was burning through his pop a lot faster, so he didn’t have the ability to stay home like we did. He later sent out for a monster hit, and was defended, but not against a raze. Rommel decided to just sacrifice his dom to take down the orc, and I ended up hitting him after the raze (along with a few others) After he was eliminated, it was down to just 8, and 27, and ourselves.
The last significant moments of the round were oddly insane. JFT in 7 had built up enough OP to break Slater and Burnt in 27, and Emesel and myself. He had kept me home for a long time, and for the first time all round I was starting to fade a bit. Then, Slater sent out on very shaky defense. He was breakable by myself, and JFT. I wanted JFT to send first, but he couldn’t do so because I was keeping him home as well in order to protect Emesel who was already out on an attack. About two hours before Slater would have been near impossible to break, I decided to just hit him. I figured that the Lyc would hit him as well because after my hit he would have had to only send Garous to break him, and if he had hit me I could have retal’d him when I got home, so I just took the chance. That is what ended up happening, and Burnt followed it up by suiciding on JFT, which I also capitalized on by hitting Burnt for about 400, along with Emesel. I decided that even on day 35 or so, it wasn’t time for a huge mod building push, and continued to go homes for the most part. I was sitting at about 70k peasants, and started training up to catch Shizzle Ma Nizzle in 15. I can only assume he gave up after the hits, because he starved for a good 10 hours or so, and didn’t even bother training/casting his spells. Although he ended up logging on and casting ares before I attacked him, it was already too late and I hit him for 700 land total (which Emesel followed) 9 hours later, I hit the Kobold again, and took another 500. I figured that was it, but in one of the weirdest things that I have ever seen in this game followed that. Bure decided to send out 1 hour before all of my land got in while being .25 acres inside of my land range, and I hit him as well for 510. In the end, I had conquered 1709 land in about a day.
</p><p>The rest of my round was pretty dull. I spent about 4 days building all of the land where I went from 0, to 14% GT’s and then ended up training to 650k OP just to make a bottom feed to match my acres up with Emesel’s. I could have gone for a lot more, but I just didn’t care. On day 41 I finally reached my max peasant pop at 114k, and only had one person in my 75% I didn’t really even login much for about 8 days until people started to get into my range.
</p><p><a href="http://img528.imageshack.us/img528/9889/peasants.jpg" class="external free" title="http://img528.imageshack.us/img528/9889/peasants.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img528.imageshack.us/img528/9889/peasants.jpg</a>
</p><p>It was a fun round, and I definitely wouldn’t have been able to get anyplace without the help from the best players in the game. They helped me through a number of situations, and they deserve just as much of the win. Congrats to Emesel on his third victory as well, that is a pretty tremendous accomplishment. It was a fun round, and I hope the game continues to live on for a long time to come. This was only my second competitive round, but it will also be my last. Good luck to all of the people that I have come to know in the few rounds I have played over the past few years.
