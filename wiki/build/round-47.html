<br />Yes, we finally did it!! I must thank everyone that was in #39 for your awesome support. Even you guys who explored helped out with wonders! I have to especially thank Alex for always beeing there helping out with ops with no complains, you rock!! Tjockochgammal also had some, if only small, part in my succes.&nbsp;;) Anders, you did a great start and helped us out a lot. Spooks, I can´t remeber when I saw such bad luck before. You really had some misstimeing making your round da worst. You will rock next time. Nedo, you really tried hard to give the opponent the upper hand giving them free land.&nbsp;;)
<br />
<br />Thought round was over just before that crazy kobbo in 28 hit Rio all in, so you deserve my thanks to. Should thank #12 for sinking my competition but I wont! I gave it back by not hitting you the last day!
<br />
<br />You can let go of my hand now Andreas!

<p><br />Day 7: Top two doms get taken down. Allegorical (Pod Rivet Danglin Redneck #28) hit GeneralRommel (Cat tails on a stick #2) for 112, who was first at the time then got hit back by sins of the father (#42) for 128, Ivetza (Cekcu cu c po3ob CyTueH #43) for 80, Morphling (Megatron #31) for 64 and Merf (so i herd u leik kobolddd #2) for 64. Also, MasterB/Brax (Odin #50) was double tapped by Switch (Thunderwing #31) for 117 and Morphling for 105. Brax was #2 at the time. Neither Allegorical, Rommel nor Brax would be a threat for the rest of the round.	
<br />
<br />Day 8: With three threats taken out, Jakers is top op at 26k. The two lycs are also dangerous as is Morphling, who made two big grabs the day before

<p><br />Day 9: Morphling and Ladeda both bounced attacks. Ladeda got farmed out following a huge hit from Jakers. Ladeda would later unconvert and become a black opper.
<br />
<br />Day 11: #50 assassinates 1350 draftees from Rio (Starscream #31) allowing their kobbo to break his 53k on a semi-suicide: <br />9:49:31 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Typhon (# 50) conquered 120 land from Starscream (# 31).
<br />
<br />Day 12: #50 declares war on #31 with the intention of sinking Bobbo (Blackout #31), who's suicidal hobbos gave him potential top op. #31 responded by fireballing Jakers and Inequality (Lotus Elise #50)

<p><br />Day 14 (later): Jakers hit Bobbo for 172 and was triple tapped by Switch, Bobbo and Anders  for 206, 185 and 126, was 8th at the time at 2142, knocked back to 15XX. 
<br />9:13:01 PM	Dirge (# 31) has attacked the Temple of the Damned!
<br />9:13:15 PM	Soundwave (# 31) has attacked the Temple of the Damned!
<br />9:13:52 PM	Starscream (# 31) has attacked the Temple of the Damned!
<br />9:14:09 PM	Megatron (# 31) has attacked the Temple of the Damned!
<br />9:14:09 PM	The Temple of the Damned has been destroyed and rebuilt by Realm #31!
<br />9:14:24 PM	Victorious on the battlefield, Thunderwing (# 31) conquered 206 land from Typhon (# 50).
<br />9:14:56 PM	Victorious on the battlefield, Blackout (# 31) conquered 185 land from Typhon (# 50).
<br />Thus after 8 days of black opping between #31 and #50, the war was finally over. Ladeda, Brax, Bobbo and Jakers were all ruined as a result.  Without peace/black ops to worry about, and just as many fast races, #39 began to make its move. Other threats were Jiriky, #2 dwarf and Takao, #28 kobbo.
</p>
<a name="Part_2" id="Part_2"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Part 2 </span></h2>
<p>Days 15-20: #50 and #12 have begun another nasty war. #12 would eventually take the ToB from them, but would result in Inequality (Lotus Elise #50) getting sunk and Brax (Odin #50) getting fireballed down to 8k pez. #12's halfers/sylvans were too powerful for #50's fast races. None of the dominions involved in this war were threats at the time except Inequality's fw, which was a threat to Rio's orc. #50 practically fell off the map from the war.
<br />
<br />Day 19: Jiriky hit Bobbo then was double tapped by Anders and Takao. With all the big evil doms, he had a lot of potential, especially with relatively efficient units.
<br />5:59:47 PM	Victorious on the battlefield, six foot gay asian dude (# 2) conquered 179 land from Blackout (# 31)
<br />5:59:55 PM	Psychotic Nuclear Bananas (# 39) has cancelled relations with us
<br />5:59:57 PM	Bouncing Nublet (# 39) invaded six foot gay asian dude (# 2) and captured 189 land.
<br />11:57:45 PM	Giant Squid-like Hamsters (# 28) invaded six foot gay asian dude (# 2) and captured 179 land.
<br />
<br />Day 20: Anders is top op around 100k while Ivetza and the 2 UD's, Arthryn (Sin #3) and Nedo (Feed me. #39) have been keeping pace by bottomfeeding; #39 now has 4 guys in the top 8

<p><br />Day 24: Perhaps the strangest move of the round, Nedo realized that Rio could hit him so he suicided his progeny on every realm except #31 resulting in an octo-tap, Sin (#3) for 270, Fairy Tale Toadstool (#23) for 271, Starscream and Soundwave (#31) for 174, 195, Kobboo and Firefly (#28) for 187 and 168, Cactuar (#50) for 151 and Mieshuora (#24) for 136; A total of 1552 land, he was 5th overall at the time.  The supposed reason for this, aside from being wasted, was that Rio and Ivetza were both out and Rio could break him when his troops got back.  Since Rio already had a slight edge over #39's top guys, Nedo tried to even the playing field by donating his acres to the rest of the top tier and second tier attackers.  Whether this move saved #39's ass or was simply an unnecessary self-destruction, we'll never be sure. I personally believe that #39 would have been ok if Rio hit Nedo, while Rio was the top dom, his dp wasn't good enough to simply hand him the victory.
<br />
<br />Day 25: Rio was now at the point where he could break 4 of the 10 people in range all-in without ares and was just 6k off breaking Ivetza all-in WITH ares.  Realizing the potential threat, Takao decided to take matters into his own hands, hoping others would follow, which didn't happen.
<br />10:59:57 PM	Victorious on the battlefield, Giant Squid-like Hamsters (# 28) conquered 374 land from Starscream (# 31).
<br />11:52:16 PM	Starscream (# 31) invaded Giant Squid-like Hamsters (# 28) and captured 234 land.
<br />11:52:16 PM	Cekcu cu c po3oB CyTueH (# 43) invaded Giant Squid-like Hamsters (# 28) and captured 195 land.
<br />11:52:16 PM	Thunderwing (# 31) invaded Giant Squid-like Hamsters (# 28) and captured 196 land.
<br />Takao ended up only down ~60 acres and had accomplished his goal of slowing Rio down (he wouldnt send until 4 days later).
<br />
<br />Day 26: No clear top threat atm; Rio, Ivetza, Anders and Flanders are all dangerous. Top OP is ~160k

<p><br />Day 33: Ivetza decided that his best chance for a decent finish was to unconvert to explorer, so he dropped all his offense.  His economy still wasn't great, but he never really fell behind.
<br />
<br />Day 35: Arthryn now has Portals to help with his bottomfeeding, Flanders (The Ivan Drago knockout! #39) is top op and looking pretty solid for the long run. Rio, Macros (Fairy Tale Toadstool #23) are also contenders.	In conjunction with the top three doms pumping op (Rio, Macros, Flanders) The speedy second tier doms began to stagnate: Switch's #31 liz, Anders's #39 lyc.

<p><br />Day 35 (later): Macros made the mistake that Rio would be able to retal Flanders if he got hit.  Rio wasn't able to, so he settled for hitting Devasas instead.  This eliminated Macros's chances of winning and turned it into a two horse race. Flanders sent 280k to hit Mac.
<br />4:58:42 PM	Victorious on the battlefield, Fairy Tale Toadstool (# 23) conquered 241 land from Giant Squid-like Hamsters (# 28).
<br />5:56:27 PM	The Ivan Drago knockout! (# 39) invaded Fairy Tale Toadstool (# 23) and captured 332 land.
<br />6:59:17 PM	Victorious on the battlefield, Starscream (# 31) conquered 273 land from BGs cant count to ten (# 40).
<br />
<br />Day 36: #31 takes OoP from #39, who then snatched Lair from #28. In the war between #39 and #28, several dominions were sunk, most notably Anders, who was already stagnating. 		
<br />
<br />Day 39: After a few days of pumping op and keeping each other home, Flanders used his 9h advantage to grab two hits off Asanka and Slinzer. Rio responded with two hits of his own off Insano and Fingal.
<br />3:57:22 AM	Victorious on the battlefield, The Ivan Drago knockout! (# 39) conquered&nbsp;? land from God of War (# 26).
<br />12:58:06 PM	Victorious on the battlefield, The Ivan Drago knockout! (# 39) conquered&nbsp;? land from Keeping it REAL! (# 42).
<br />2:59:36 AM	Victorious on the battlefield, Starscream (# 31) conquered 295 land from Lusting for Cellulite (# 12).

<a name="Part_3" id="Part_3"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Part 3 </span></h2>
<p>Day 41: Flanders is still the best shot to win and he's gaining ground on Arthryn. Anders hasn’t recovered from being sunk but not too many other guys have been catching up, 12 looks like they could make a late run with their attechers kicking in their speed.

<p><br />Day 48: #12 is growing rapidly now as their techers (Sasha) and sylvans(Ronddraai, BsDoS) are able to hit every 12h/9h. However, with two attackers capable of breaking them, they were forced to sink someone. Rio was being kept home by Flanders, who was out of range for most of #12's halfers.  As a result, they were able to continue hitting safely by sinking Rio.
<br />
<br />Day 49: With Rio sunk, Flanders is able to hit Rio all-in again without fear of a retal, putting him over 8k and a shoo-in for the victory.
<br />2:57:36 PM	The Ivan Drago knockout! (# 39) invaded Starscream (# 31) and captured 507 land.
<br />In other big news this day, Kobboo (#28), who was still angry at #39 over a nasty war, had finished a week's worth of training and was able to break #39's monarch, Anders, who was 14th at the time. Kobboo then provided critical hits that allowed mleduc and Ronddraai to crack the top 10.
<br />12:56:26 PM	Victorious on the battlefield, Kobboo (# 28) conquered 545 land from Bouncing Nublet (# 39). 
<br />1:59:52 PM	The Pirates Revenge (# 7) invaded Kobboo (# 28) and captured 305 land.
<br />2:57:36 PM	The Ivan Drago knockout! (# 39) invaded Kobboo (# 28) and captured 283 land.
<br />
<br />Day 50: In the final hours, Macros and Rio were still unable to send, allowing Sasha and Tjockogammal to make big hits. In Sasha's case, he sent with the anticipation of getting nailed by Flanders, however, as an unspoken thank you for sinking Macros, Flanders's mercifully let Sasha come home safely. With no one able to catch him, Flanders secured the win by staying home on the last day. It is incredibly rare for a winner to make one hit in the last five days, but Flanders's cautious style proved to be sufficient for the victory.

pretty interesting round as #2 (I think it's #2 that is). Though I doubt
anyone is actually interested in the story of that *annoying lame
bottomfeeder* but maybe there is still someone who thinks it's worth the
read.&nbsp;:p 
</p><p>First of all, my motivation to play this round was really low. Thus, I
decided not to play in some hyper active 6pack and all. Basically my
plan was to pick undead and suicide the entire round to see how many
converts I could get and to just attack every 12h and train nothing but
vamps and use converts as defense. I got in a realm filled with nubs
mostly, I was being a real b*tz in protection and made the king delete
after only a few days (well he was a real retard..) and pretty much
called all my realmies nubs and retards. Surprisingly they still all
voted me as monarch a few days later; strange world it is indeed.. 
</p><p>I used an old undead sim morph once made (the same one BR won with I
believe), fittingly entitled GodLike V2.0, which I upgraded with latest
tweaks and all to GodLike V3.0&nbsp;:p
I came oop on 675 acres with about 4k dp and 3.3k op. I made 2 hits and
regrettably failed a small third due to me being stupid and attacking
the wrong dominion! For the next week I kept hitting every 12h and was
growing rapidly till I reached the top10 and stayed in those ranks for
the rest of the round, being among the top 3 for about 50% of the round.
</p><p>Unfortunately, this ruined my original plan to suicide for the fun!
Getting in top 10, with good position and awesome economy and then just
tossing it away is such a shame.. (and I?m such a nerd) thus I started
to actively try to get as big as possible, and after I noticed it was
impossible to keep up hitting in 75% range I went down to bottomfeeding
(it was just impossible to keep hitting 75% with my offense and defense
as low as it was.. I calced I'd have to spend a week training op/dp to
hit in 75% again by which time I would need even more due to top op
increasing rapidly). I noticed bottomfeeding with spud was actually
pretty nice; the converts I would get far exceeded the plat I would have
to spend on the increased buildcost.
</p><p>Top offense was already getting really high with #31 pushing high mods
and everyone was busy training defense or offense. I never had this
problem and was just able to keep hitting in 60%+ range while keeping
incredibly solid defense at home (I made sure to recast ares on every
hit, as the only thing that could happen was if some realm would snare
me and hit me when ares runs off and troops still out due to 9hr
attacks). By this time my realmies had already grabbed the portals for
me (I had to haggle with one guy in my realm who insisted that High
Clerics Tower was far superior but managed to convince him in the end!
yeah.. don't ask..). Portals made my life a lot less difficult for sure.&nbsp;;) 
</p><p>Luckily, somewhere midround, the orc in #31 was suicided and put to a
quick stop for a few days. At around this time the #39 undead suicided
and I was the first to notice (mostly because he and the orc were the
only two doms I was checking during that time. The orc for his offense,
the undead for? well he being my nemesis in trying to get my top undead
rank!!!). I grabbed about 400 acres and together with the orc (who got a
piece of the suicider as well) got a huge lead on the rest. My economy
was insane, and I was still able to grow while everyone else was busy
training dp/op.
</p><p>I realized my only chance in winning at that stage was to get enough of
a lead on the rest, so I could actually train some offense again and bf
to the win, though I knew chanced would be very very slim. Still I
managed to take a lead of about 700 acres at one point compared to the
number 2. At this time two gobo's suddenly appeared out of nowhere with
high op and gaining land fast. One was in #23 and the other in #39.
Those two, together with the orc started training craploads of offense
and pretty much forced the game in to the freezer. At this time even I
had to start training some defense and this was the time I knew I
wouldn't have a chance anymore (defense is so expensive&nbsp;:[ ).
</p><p>Also people were all getting in a guard, even those in 40-50% landsize,
which was probably due to me feeding on them if they wouldn't. At some
time there were only like 4-5 doms in my 40-60% range.. that made life
really had and had to hit doms who had excellent defense for their size,
just not compared to my op. (I must have gotten about a few dozen
messages of *love*mail.. detailing their dreams of seeing me die behind
my keyboard etc.. maybe they had a point though; one guy in #5, Ancient
Towers I believe, I actually hit 7 times but well what can I say.. he
was really stubborn about joining a guard I guess&nbsp;:p) 
</p><p>Not to mention that I've been fireballed by 3 realms for a total of 2
weeks. First by some realm who was pissed about my bottomfeeding. I must
have lost a few million plat at least, plat I really needed to try and
win. The second time was a single undead in #15 who wanted to kill me
cuz he just knew I had to be cheating.. (I was big, he wasn't, thus I
was cheating..) and the third time by #4 with some complete retards who
were just *bored*.
</p><p>Yet, it made the round entertaining, and especially the last few days
were interesting and exciting to see if I would keep my #2 rank (which I
hope remains as it is). It came close in the end when some nox in #39
suddenly turned up out of nowhere, but luckily invasion was disabled
prior to him making his final hit. I wouldn't have mind ending up #3 as
long as it would have been the orc in #31 as he, me and the gob were
fighting it over for pretty much 50% of the round and having a lead of
about 1k+ acres a week before roundend. After the orc got killed by a
spec op push by the gob in the last week though, it was game over. I was
still able to keep growing a bit because of portals and my insane amount
of defense, while everyone else had to keep troops all-in, though my
hits were limited to 40% hits for about 80 acres/hit (but it's better
then nothing at all).
</p><p>In short, it was a fun round, though it seems boring it was actually
one of my most entertaining rounds ever. Too bad I didn't had a nice
pack backing me up I guess&nbsp;:p 
</p><p>On side note.. I had crazy realmies. One guy (same who insisted HCT
rules) actually managed to get invaded for about 7k!!!! acres during the
round and still managed to end on 2k acres (an incredible feat if you
ask me).

<p>Day 5/50

</p><p>3:56:34 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Starscream (# 31) conquered 66 land from Google This! (# 50).
</p><p>4:48:25 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Starscream (# 31) conquered 65 land from Professor Xavier (# 9). 
</p><p>This was the day that (#28) kobold suicided Cat tails on a stick (#2) then got farmed down.  It was also the day that Switch got to hit Odin (#50) who I had been arguing with on the boards about his fishy hits OOP.  I've come to the belief that he did just get lucky but I did take pride in being a douche by saying: 
</p><p>"He either farmed or he is so damn lucky that it isn't even funny. Either way, he doesn't deserve to be in a good position and I'm hoping that it's just a matter of time before the skill-gap catches up with him." 
</p><p>I knew he was gonna get hit if he sent and sure enough, he did.  (#50) were falling to pieces at this stage and Morph was then able to double Odin up. 
</p><p>7:58:39 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Starscream (# 31) conquered 74 land from Infect:Annex At All Costs (# 33).
</p><p>9:56:37 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Starscream (# 31) conquered 75 land from God Of War (# 26). 
</p><p>Switch had to cover me for a few hours since a few people had pumped up to decent OP and could hit me fairly easily.  The land took me to top spot for the first time this round. 
</p><p>The next day really, really sucked.  First Switch bounced by having two attack calc pages open and sending the wrong amount on a hit and then ladeda bounced by sending on the wrong person in a realm.  ladeda had also sent out really fat which we didn't know about.  Switch had been unwittingly covering him but sent out not knowing lad's DP and lad took a monster hit from Typhon right before their Peace went active. 
</p><p>Speaking of Peaces... of the 70 people in range of me, I had 3 people without peace on us.  I then managed to hit one of them when he suicided on #24, which we thought had been to farm out to jiriky (#2 dorf).. I got the 2nd hit with a rushed send. 
</p><p>11:59:50 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Starscream (# 31) conquered 77 land from Terminator (# 42). 
</p><p>Early on, we had a very strong position but at this moment, our pack's dominant position was crippled.  A bunch of the speed whores were ahead of us and any one of them might have had a runaway.  Our position was delicate.  I was playing much more efficient than any of the people above me but way less efficient than the techers below me so I knew that I needed to somehow get ahead by the time all the techers had converted. 
</p><p>We finally cancelled war on #50 after we had snared and fireballed the kobold, forcing him to train spies for the first time since day 5. 
</p><p>I managed to get a hit in despite the kobold being able to hit me since Morph had pumped some nice suicidal OP to keep him home. 
</p><p>10:58:29 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Starscream (# 31) conquered 83 land from God Of War (# 26). 
</p><p>Then just before my troops were home, (#50) assassinated my draftees from 1600 to 250 so that the kobold could semi-suicide.  I had 53k DP.  He left 50.2k on higher land.  Did he get hit?  Nope - lucky him. 
</p><p>1/27/2008 9:49:31 PM   An army from Typhon (# 50) invaded our lands, conquering 120 acres of land! We lost 9 draftees, 0 Savages, 62 Guards, 240 Voodoo Magi and 3 Bone Breakers during the battle. 
</p><p>It did enable me to make another prestige hit though: 
</p><p>3:57:36 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Starscream (# 31) conquered 81 land from The Incredible Hulk (# 9). 
</p><p>We'd taken War off of #50 so that we could concentrate on growing.  Then about 23 hours later, they declared on us to sink Bobbo.  We responded by keeping up the fireballs on Typhon and their FW (Lotus Elise) so that they wouldn't get off easy.  The ongoing war with #50 meant that all the other people at the top were able to keep growing quite safely while us and #50 tore eachother apart. 
</p><p>At this point, we'd had 90-95% of people in range have Peace on us for the last week so making prestige hits had become a real pain in the ass.  I would have been in a much nicer postion without all the Peaces but just keeping up was becoming hard right now. 
</p><p>I finally managed to catch a halfer with frenzy off (thanks to lad + switch for revs before and after hc): 
</p><p>10:00:06 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Starscream (# 31) conquered 101 land from Pathfinder (# 6). 
</p><p>The war with (#50) had been raging for 9 of the 11 days since OOP.  The damage done to both sides had at this point been:
</p><p>- We sunk Typhon
</p><p>- We snared Typhon
</p><p>- We double-tapped Odin
</p><p>- Typhon hit Dirge
</p><p>- Typhon hit me
</p><p>- They sunk Bobbo
</p><p>- We FB'd Typhon
</p><p>- We double-tapped Valefor 
</p><p>There were also a huge number of other black ops done to eachother.  Both our packs were all over black op ranks.  I don't think anyone else in dom had a clue about the extent of the damage we had been doing to each other.  This war just lasted forever and it didn't look like an end would soon be coming.  I'm sure either #50 or ourselves would have run by now if we hadn't been ripping into eachother.  But due to the ongoing war, everyone else was growing steadily without incident. 
</p><p>Now it was Day 14.  Wonders had starting to fall.  The other big superpower - Realm #39 managed to take the Obelisk from a smaller realm 27 hours after it fell and #50 managed to take the Temple of the Blessed from #0 giving both realms the edge.  #50 had been instantly warred but for the time they had it, they would be a pain in the ass.  Lotus Elise had 6 point salamanders against me and huge OP with war and the ToB and Typhon's OP was just insane with a grunt pump. 
</p><p>Bobbo had sent out on one of the few peaceless people in our range and Typhon once again semi-suicided on us, leaving way less DP on higher land once again.  I guess other attackers don't know how to calc kobbos since nobody touched him again... well, apart from us: 
</p><p>3:59:32 PM Typhon (# 50) invaded Blackout (# 31) and captured 172 land. 
</p><p>(biggest hit of the round so far) 
</p><p>This time, we had a plan.  Bobbo had sent before we knew Typhon had grunt pumped so I had a sick feeling he would send on Bobbo.  The Temple of the Damned hadn't fallen yet but we knew it would have been taking small amounts of damage by now as the Temple of the Blessed had fallen much earlier.  Once Bobbo and Bell's troops had returned, we came up with an order to hit the ToD and then get as many hits as possible on Typhon: 
</p><p>9:13:01 PM Dirge (# 31) has attacked the Temple of the Damned!
</p><p>9:13:15 PM Soundwave (# 31) has attacked the Temple of the Damned!
</p><p>9:13:52 PM Starscream (# 31) has attacked the Temple of the Damned!
</p><p>9:14:09 PM Megatron (# 31) has attacked the Temple of the Damned!
</p><p>9:14:09 PM The Temple of the Damned has been destroyed and rebuilt by Realm #31!
</p><p>9:14:24 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Thunderwing (# 31) conquered 206 land from Typhon (# 50).
</p><p>9:14:56 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Blackout (# 31) conquered 185 land from Typhon (# 50). 
</p><p>(new biggest hits of the round) 
</p><p>We had hoped to get the wonder with just Dirge and Soundwave sending so that the remaining 4 of us could quad hit Typhon but ToD had more hit points than we would have liked so we only managed the double. 
</p><p>I should say really that the war we had with #50 was probably the most gruelling experience I've ever had in dom.  It was absolutely fantastic competition as we did every trick in the book to take eachother down.  Saying we outplayed them would be unjust as they managed to get a whole bunch of solid hits on us and took out Bobbo when he was top OP.  In the end, Typhon took one too many risks and paid for it. 
</p><p>Finally with (#50) dealt with, we could just get back to the land race which (#39) had been able to take the lead on without anyone stopping them.... 
</p>
<a name="Act_II_-_The_Land_Rush" id="Act_II_-_The_Land_Rush"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Act II - The Land Rush  </span></h2>
<p>(#39) definitely had the edge at this point.  They had nowhere near as many peaces as we did (if any at all) even though they had the land lead and a solid wonder in the Obelisk.  Fortunately, we weren't too far behind and by now, I was up to 900 prestige with 250 DMs on 2.1k land.  We just had to catch #39 somehow and take care of the numerous other threats around, especially jiriky (#2 dorf). 
</p><p>A few more prestige hits: 
</p><p>2:59:27 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Starscream (# 31) conquered 118 land from God Of War (# 26).
</p><p>(sorry again dude - only other peaceless person that was hittable was a sylvan who r/r to 80% forest and dropped spies to draftees the hour I planned to hit him)
</p><p>12:59:52 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Starscream (# 31) conquered 111 land from ShKrat (# 48).
</p><p>(realm-mate of the guy that r/r - their Peace went active 3 hours later.)
</p><p>3:59:33 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Starscream (# 31) conquered 126 land from The Frozen Throne (# 39).
</p><p>(#39 had actually been the first realm to un-Peace us in order to Peace dorf instead... they were now the only people in range that didn't have Peace on us so thanks) 
</p><p>What happened the following day I am not proud of.  Lotus Elise (#50) had pumped Salamanders for days and with those plus the ToB that they were taking would have 113k vs me with 5.5% reduction where the next top OP was ~95k.  The last thing our pack needed was to go to War with #50 again to sink him but this is what needed to be done.  Then I noticed that he had 4 prestige missing between his last two CSes so figured they must be at mutual war with (#12) - the people they wanted to take ToB from.  I sent a message to #12's queen advising them that the best black op in the game is sinking and that if they wanted to damage #50 the most, they should pick on people with low docks.  A few hours later, Lotus Elise was sunk.  It did make me feel a little dirty since every pack I am ever in does all the hard work ourselves. Oh well.. I didn't need to add this part as nobody would have known it was my idea but it did happen so I figured I'd add it. 
</p><p>With Lotus taken care of, I just hit a sylvan: 
</p><p>3:59:58 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Starscream (# 31) conquered 123 land from pLaYaZparadise (# 22).
</p><p>(First Peace hit of the round...) 
</p><p>Day 19/50 
</p><p>This was the day that jiriky (#2 dorf) got taken care of 
</p><p>5:59:47 PM Victorious on the battlefield, six foot gay asian dude (# 2) conquered 179 land from Blackout
</p><p>5:59:55 PM Psychotic Nuclear Bananas (# 39) has cancelled relations with us
</p><p>5:59:57 PM Bouncing Nublet (# 39) invaded six foot gay asian dude (# 2) and captured 189 land.
</p><p>11:57:45 PM Giant Squid-like Hamsters (# 28) invaded six foot gay asian dude (# 2) and captured 179 land. 
</p><p>(#28) obviously then feared the potential danger that (#39) posed against Good doms with a strong lyc and a strong gobbo against them so they removed peace from us and placed it on (#39).  Then one of them sent.  I guess they had no idea I had top OP by 10k or so at that point so I made an unexpected huge prestige hit: 
</p><p>4:59:04 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Starscream (# 31) conquered 149 land from Firefly (# 28). 
</p><p>Then I managed to get another Peaceless hit on (#39)... I have no idea why he 9-houred.  If they didn't have my ops then I severely over-estimated them. 
</p><p>8:22:58 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Starscream (# 31) conquered 185 land from Fantasma (# 39). 
</p><p>Thos 2 hits put me up from 970 prestige to 1078 so I was starting to look good now.  I was in a really nice position.  All of our closest rivals were way less efficient than me and at this point, I really thought I could go all the way again. 
</p><p>End of Day 21:

</p><p>10  CHAMpagne  Lizardfolk  39  2,721 
</p><p>It was beginning to look like it would come down to us vs #39.  Winner take all.  Neither of us could afford to let techers catch us so someone had to go.  Bouncing Nublet lived true to his name and bounced on Devasas.  He couldn't anywhere near full send so I was shocked when I saw his nw drop.  He had just miscalc'd and it cost him.  I was able to make a grab on #2 kobbo.  The worst possible hit for an orc - 20% GTs and Peace.  But it was land: 
</p><p>4:59:38 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Starscream (# 31) conquered 167 land from Cat tails on a stick (# 2). 
</p><p>There were a couple of things concerning me at this point.  (#39) gobbo had pumped 1200 spies earlier in the day.  He already had enough for ops on most people so it told me one thing: black ops.  I would be susceptible to both snares and sinking so 12 hours before they were able to remove Peace and then War us, I pumped a load of spies.  I heard through the grapevine that they thought they had a spy in their realm since apparently they had just posted in council about the possibility of warring us.  I r just smrt. 
</p><p>I also didn't realise though that the hour after I sent, jiriky (#2) dorf got land in bringing him back into my range.  He had openly said he was just looking to suicide and this was his best chance.  I was pretty worried but Switch, ladeda and me sat down and calc'd his best chances of 4:3ing me and realised he'd be a few thousand short fortunately. 
</p><p>Day 24/50 
</p><p>Took my first 2 scalps of the round (people deleting/farming out to avoid me).  I was really close to hitting the (#2) gnome earlier but hit his packy instead since I could hit him there and then but needed a few hours for the gnome.  I spec pumped some savages after I sent to give me pretty decent OP for when my troops returned.  I then realised that the gnome hadn't trained in time so my troops and specs would be back the hour before his DP would arrive.  He would have to wall pump, draftee release or stock drafts to be safe.  When he checked me out, apparently he didn't like either of these options so he took it upon himself to make an alternative decision: 
</p><p>10:18:24 PM Cruzer (# 2) has been abandoned by its ruler. 
</p><p>Cruzer was by far the greatest converter threat at that point so we were back to dealing with fast attackers for the time being. 
</p><p>Then. apparently because he was drunk and miscalced my OP, Nedo (#39 undead) decided he wanted to farm out.  He had sent 2 hours after me and then realised later that I could hit him so he sent out as much DP as possible a couple hours before my troops were back in order to farm out to others.  He sent out to a bunch of different realms as a message of "hey! look at me! you can hit me!".  Unfortunately, Arthryn (Sin #3 undead) was awake and managed to get a hit in.  Sin could usually only hit 50-60% with his OP so this was truly a gift for him.  At this point he was having to wait for me to send before he could even BF.  (#23) gobbo who had doubled my previous hit was also able to get a massive 9 hour land gain too... increasing his land by 25% or so with 2 hits.  I woke up 30 minutes before my troops returned, prem-searched and saw the 540 acre drop, checked him out and prayed nobody else would get a hit on him then sent as soon as my troops were home. 
</p><p>6:57:20 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Feed me. (# 39) conquered 99 land from Arrogant Bastard Ale (# 3).
</p><p>2:44:38 AM Sadly, the forces of Feed me. (# 39) were beaten back by Lotus Elise (# 50).
</p><p>2:44:55 AM Sadly, the forces of Feed me. (# 39) were beaten back by six foot gay asian dude (# 2).
</p><p>2:45:05 AM Sadly, the forces of Feed me. (# 39) were beaten back by Fairy Tale Toadstool (# 23).
</p><p>2:45:42 AM Sadly, the forces of Feed me. (# 39) were beaten back by Giant Squid-like Hamsters (# 28).
</p><p>2:46:44 AM Sadly, the forces of Feed me. (# 39) were beaten back by BGs cant count to ten (# 40).
</p><p>3:26:05 AM Sin (# 3) invaded Feed me. (# 39) and captured 270 land.
</p><p>3:28:04 AM Fairy Tale Toadstool (# 23) invaded Feed me. (# 39) and captured 271 land. 
</p><p>Then us: 
</p><p>4:00:14 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Starscream (# 31) conquered 174 land from Feed me. (# 39).
</p><p>4:00:55 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Soundwave (# 31) conquered 195 land from Feed me. (# 39). 
</p><p>This pivotal incident made it onto the boards.  Nedo did all he could to not give me land.  I would have made a much larger hit if he hadn't farmed out.  He sent when only Ivetza and myself were out in order to give everyone but us 2 a chance of hitting him so it's pretty retarded to say he tried farming to me.  Nobody else saw it until after I got my hit in so the plan backfired on him.  If he planned to farm to me, he could have done it minutes before my troops got back as I had more than enough to double him.  As he was only in range for 1 hit though, I just sent all my specs at him.  I had calced in my head my raw OP instead of modded so I sent 120k of my 160k OP on a 75k hit. 
</p><p>So basically, instead of only me making a big hit, I made a slightly smaller hit as well as 6 or 7 other people getting free land who simply didn't have enough OP to make a hit otherwise.  A lot of people whined about it simply because they didn't understand the situation.  Ivetza summed it up: 
</p><p>Posted at: 2/9/2008 3:33:13 PM 
</p><p>hehe you are half right sure , they never sleep but about farming you mistake i think the undead just dont want to donate his land to 31 orc and he sui to be smashed from other realm dominions if you look close will see he hit any top doms than #31 and try to bring attention on him before orc return .... noobish mistake to miss his op after #39 is top realm ...... 
</p><p>-Ivetza 
</p><p>Just as a note about not sleeping.  In the past, I've sometimes called Bell to make a login for me if (and only if) I'm away for a few days and can't get to a computer.  If I had a phone with internet access, I would just use that.  This round, that did not happen at all.  Those 24 hour trains for days and days.  Those were all me.  I kept up my middle-of-the-night trains/hits in order to make sure nobody could capitalise when they thought I would be sleeping.  So call it sad if you like, but it was 100% all me. 
</p><p>Day 25/50 
</p><p>I had been away during the morning and pumped BoneBreakers and then 3 hours of Savages when I returned.  I was now at the point where I could break 4 of the 10 people in range all in without ares and was just 6k off breaking (#39) lyc all in WITH ares.  One of the people I needed ares to drop on, Takao - the kobbo in (#28) decided to turn the tables and semi-suicide on ME when I was all in WITH ares.  I'm sure he got a kick out of it: 
</p><p>10:59:57 PM Giant Squid-like Hamsters (# 28) invaded Starscream (# 31) and captured 374 land. 
</p><p>I could break him by well over 20k so I did: 
</p><p>11:52:16 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Starscream (# 31) conquered 234 land from Giant Squid-like Hamsters (# 28). 
</p><p>Ivetza then doubled.  Both #39 gobbo and lyc could hit him too but ironically, I kept them from sending, being able to hit either of them if they did send.  The funny thing was, (#28) were the pretty much the only people within RG range of me without peace and I was too big for him to take prestige off me but I got some off him so that took me ever-closer to the magic 1200 barrier.  Takao was actually pretty cool about it in in-game messages.  He did it to stop a runaway and put a HUGE stop on my plans so well done to him for having the balls that the rest of the dom community wish they had. 
</p><p>Day 29/50 
</p><p>The hit on me by #28 completely turned the round.  He annoyingly said that if one hit can stop a round win, then it wasn't on the cards for me to win anyway.  A little breakdown for what the hit did:
</p><p>- Lost troops = 9 hours of plat for re-training
</p><p>- Rebuilding land = 12 hours plat
</p><p>- Lost income = ~4 hours plat 
</p><p>The effect of it in real terms was this: Before the hit I had 155k DP and 190k OP.  The top sendable OP was 150k and everyone had 200k DP trained.  Those lost 25 hours meant that I couldn't train any more OP and since everyone already had enough DP, people were allowed to train pure OP.  That meant that after I was done rebuilding, I had to train pure DP on top of the lost hours I spent replacing my troops and rebuilding.  It was because of this that it took a full 4 days to be able to send. 
</p><p>The other annoying thing is that people would train to defend me when they got into range but apparently didn't bother with building DP if they weren't in range.  My next hit for instance was someone on 3096 land who took 205k DP with 19% GTs (225k of my max OP).  #39 gobbo managed to get a hit on someone at 2970 land with 190k OP and #23 gobbo managed to hit someone with on 2980 land with 128k (once frenzy dropped - not much more with it on).  It's very frustrating having a more efficient strategy with more military and still struggling for hits when your rivals are hitting freely. 
</p><p>11:17:02 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Starscream (# 31) conquered 208 land from Clan...Musashi (# 19). 
</p><p>11:00:12 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Starscream (# 31) conquered 204 land from Daymaker (# 12). 
</p><p>I had pumped enough OP to hit him all in with Ares on the hour before but it ran out that hour so figured I may as well send right at HC just in case I could get lower casualties.  It didn't work but oh well. 
</p><p><br />
Day 33/50
</p><p>We were now moving in to the home stretch.  The 39 gobbo had managed to make a triple hit with not great OP in order to come from behind to overtake me and give himself a huge peasant lead.  3 undead and 43 lyc were a little further ahead of 39 gobbo with 39 lyc, Mac (23 gobbo), Switch (Thunderwing) and devasas (40 dorf) completing the top attackers at this point. 
</p><p>Rank  Dominion  Race  Realm  Land
</p><p>1  Sin  Undead  3  5,255
</p><p>2  Cekcu cu c po3oB CyTueH  Lycanthrope  43  5,008

</p><p>7  Thunderwing  Lizardfolk  31  3,982
</p><p>8  BGs cant count to ten  Dwarf  40  3,846 
</p><p>All the top 8 were attackers which is just awesome.  9th and 10th were explorers so they get no love from me. 
</p>
<a name="Act_III_-_8.2C7.2C6.2C5.2C4.2C3.2C2...1" id="Act_III_-_8.2C7.2C6.2C5.2C4.2C3.2C2...1"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Act III - 8,7,6,5,4,3,2...1  </span></h2>
<p>At this point, there were realistically 5 of us who stood a chance of winning (3 undead, 43 lyc, 39 gobbo, 23 gobbo and me) with the other 3 in the top 8 still able to make an impact.  Over the next few days, the numbers dropped steadily from 8 to 3. 
</p><p>Realm #33 had taken our wonder (twice) and it was now on pretty high HP so we decided not to war to get it back.  Instead, we went for the big boys - Realm 39.   
</p><p>6:05:01 PM We have declared WAR on Psychotic Nuclear Bananas (# 39)! 
</p><p>Both myself and 39 gobbo (as well as Mac) had pumped some huge spies so sinking/snaring was out of the question.  It would be an OP race between myself and 39 gobbo to decide who would come out on top. 
</p><p>At this point, I'd like to give a special mention to Realm 31 - our realm were one of the greatest bunch of players I've ever been put in with - some of them insisted on Wars constantly and all of the mid-range attackers were happy to do their part in wonder bashes.  Even though our council wasn't really active, they would all point out potential targets for each other even if they couldn't hit them themselves and would readily help eachother out for ops.  Nothing seemed to phase them so I gotta thank them for all the help they provided.  It must have sucked for them since we were only ~8th largest/strongest realm but still had Peaces from 1/3 of the playerbase. 
</p><p>Early in day 33, Ivetza (43 lyc) decided that his inefficient attacker wasn't working.  He had BF'd his last 2 hits and decided to release garous in order to explore to the end.  His peasant number still sucked but he was sitting on decent land so could at least make a go of it. 
</p><p>Then came another period of OP pumping.  Both 23 and 39 gobbos decided to forego DP and train OP instead.  Neither of them were safe on a full send from myself or eachother but it appeared that they would both try to suicide 9 hour after me should I send first.  I trained to defend Mac all out but not 39.  If 39 hit me, then Mac would be able to hit 39 but not double me.  This hurt our 3 populations badly but it completely crippled Switch, 39 lyc and pretty much every other inefficient attacker. 
</p><p>Day 35/50 
</p><p>Then Mac made a mistake.  He had sent out thinking that if 39 gobbo hit him, that either I or Mac himself could retal.  Unfortunately neither was true so gobbo made a huge hit on him putting him 600 acres ahead.  I managed to get a 300 acre hit on one of the Ancients putting me 300 acres behind.  I used all the mountains for GNs in order to hit again soon.  At this point, wonders were being traded.  We had taken the Obelisk from #39 prior to my hit and then #39 had taken the Lair from #28 when it was on cheap HP.  #28 had not taken it straight back strangely but when #39 undeclared on them, they declared war straight back to take it 24 hours later.  #39 then put their attention to the ToD from #33 but I managed to get a hit on devasas (40 dorf) in between them losing the Lair and taking the Temple: 
</p><p>6:59:17 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Starscream (# 31) conquered 273 land from BGs cant count to ten (# 40). 
</p><p>Then we came to another OP grind.  Macros was now over 700 acres behind now and pretty much completely out of the race but still had decent OP.  39 goblin decided to pump to 4:3 OP for some reason even though both myself and Mac could easily hit him on a full send.  He actually pumped enough to hit me all in but instead of trying to defend it, I just made sure I would be able to retal easily so I started spec pumping.  After the first day of our OP pumping, he started to do high amounts of shams with all the spare draftees he had.  I made sure that I covered his all out DP by a long way so that he would need to keep his 2.4k hobgoblins home as well as a few thousand wolf riders so that all the OP he pumped would be completely useless.  He couldn't match me on his DP either as we had similar populations and he couldn't draft enough.  He was training 3 point specs with 52% DP mods against me whereas I had 4 point specs with 48.6% mods against him so unless a really great target came into range, I could camp him home. 
</p><p>The idea behind this was in order to prepare for the final week.  It was fairly obvious that this race would come down to a sprint finish which meant after maybe one more OP pump, it would be whoever could get the most decent sized hits in that would win this.  As my OP would be much cheaper than his to replace, I wanted our pops to be as low as possible in order for our incomes to be tiny.  That would give me the edge.  With the gobbo still training wolf riders, I would be able to train OP at twice the speed going OP specs only myself.  I also still had the ability to mod up on DP whereas he was fully modded already so with 10 days left, I was still in with a good shot. 
</p><p>The gobbo manage to 9 hour though unfortunately on the two very much underdefended people in range: an icekin and a kobbo.  I had ops on them both already but I needed gobbo to send before I could hit the icekin and the kobbo wasn't quite in range so he managed to take them both (leaving ~4k wolf riders AND 2.4k hobs home so I was short on him by 5k both sends).  I then managed to get a hit on a sylvan all in.  I covered his DP by 55k since he had no GTs and that was without a CS since Bell and ladeda - the wiz ops gurus were not online: 
</p><p>2:59:36 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Starscream (# 31) conquered 295 land from Lusting for Cellulite (# 12). 
</p><p>I then realised it would be time to BF which I was dreading.  This would open me up to black ops from everyone despite very clearly being the #2 dominion.  ladeda got ops on another exploring kobold with 8% GTs or so that I could hit by 40 although he would be a 68% hit.  He was a nice backup but we decided to check to see if I could hit anyone in EG range.  fingal (#4 sylvan) looked the best bet since they had switched peace to #39 earlier in the day and he had very low GTs on our last survey 600 acres earlier.  We found his GTs were still low and that I was agonisingly close.  Though even if I could hit him, it meant BFing afterwards would be too dangerous as his realm were spending their time fireballing anyone that offended them in any way... it didn't look good.  The hit itself was hard to plan:  I would have to forge-pump for 3 hours with gems + ore plus 330k stocked lumber, hope he didn't rezone to full forest, hope he won't release spies to drafts AND hope he wouldn't wall pump enough.  Switch grabbed a land spy once I had done my forge pump and it showed 79.54% forest meaning I could hit without a huge wall dump.  Switch got a new castle but failed the first one so I just clicked send and fortunately it was enough: 
</p><p>5:23:19 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Starscream (# 31) conquered 320 land from Champagne Socialist (# 4). 
</p><p>Once again as a comparison for my hits vs gobbo's hits: 
</p><p>His:
</p>
<ol><li>42 Icekin - 345k
</li></ol>
<ol><li>26 Kobold - 330k 
</li></ol>
<p>Mine -
</p>
<ol><li>12 sylvan - 357k
</li></ol>
<ol><li>4 sylvan - 417k 
</li></ol>
<p>I hit the first sylvan 2 hours after he hit the kobbo and the #4 sylvan 3 hours after my troops returned so it's not like DPs rose that high due to time.  I'm only adding this in case people thought fingal let me hit him.   
</p><p>With 2 hits each, both 39 goblin and myself had both overtaken the 3 undead and so his chances of victory were waining also. 
</p><p>Day 42/50 
</p><p>When my troops returned, I then broke cover and BF'd: 
</p><p>5:59:43 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Starscream (# 31) conquered 227 land from Seoultrain (# 22). 
</p><p>My main concern was being black-op'd by #4 since I had hit fingal.  Even though fingal and I are friends and former packmates, we always put that aside in-game when we don't pack so I knew he would get me back.  Bell CV'd shortly after I had hit the 22 kobold and we found that they had mutualled the realm taking their wonder instead so I would at least be safe from #4. 
</p><p>During the last 3 sends, I had just been training troops without building much land at all so I now had over 800 land barren with 340 more on the way.  I decided to hit the kobold as I wanted hills to build into GTs and despite my homes being on forest, I would just leave them barren to avoid paying full price.  My population was completely ruined at this stage, especially compared to the gobbo who had built on all of his land and only started training OP when most of it was built.  Our differing tactics gave me a huge land lead but his income was much stronger.  This was all quite deliberate.  His only real chances of beating me would be to hit me as I had a decent lead coming into the last week.  His OP was simply too expensive to match mine and his losses would be greater too because of my magi casualty reduction.  He basically had time now for just 1 big hit before having to join me in BFing so he had to make it a big one. 
</p><p>11:59:21 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Starscream (# 31) conquered 255 land from buy iPwn get iWin free (# 12). 
</p><p>Incidentally, immediately following this hit, I took land daily bonus.  It added it for both pre- and post-midnight so I got screwed out of another 20 acres by Ross. 
</p><p>2:59:17 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Starscream (# 31) conquered 221 land from De Gothia (# 12). 
</p><p>Each send became riskier and riskier with 39 gobbo continuing to increase his OP without sending so he started to gradually catch my DP.  Also, since I had so much barren, my population was still quite low and my smithy&nbsp;% was falling fast so training military was becoming expensive business. 
</p><p>Day 44/50 
</p><p>It was pretty much sewn up at this point.  39 gobbo needed to hit me in order to take the win and he kept pumping OP in order to do that without training DP.  I built GTs and trained enough DP to cover his OP by quite a lot all in and just decided to send when he did.  The rankings tell the story: 
</p><p>1  Starscream  Orc  31  7,689
</p><p>2  Sin  Undead  3  6,679
</p><p>3  The Ivan Drago knockout!  Goblin  39  6,465
</p><p>4  Cekcu cu c po3oB CyTueH  Lycanthrope  43  5,732
</p><p>5  Fairy Tale Toadstool  Goblin  23  5,363
</p><p>6  Bouncing Nublet  Lycanthrope  39  5,274
</p><p>7  Stiff Upper Lip  Nox  39  5,228
</p><p>8  buy iPwn get iWin free  Halfling  12  5,193
</p><p>9  Neo Bahamut  Sylvan  50  5,155
</p><p>10  Spider Pig  Icekin  31  4,919
</p>
<ul><li> This is where I stopped the journal unfortunately after I was hit.  What happened was this: 39 gobbo had stocked a load of draftees so I knew a spec pump would be coming.  The next morning I had to wake up at 4-5am to pick my parents up from the airport.  Because of sleepiness, I trained Magi instead of Guards which allowed 39 to spec-pump me.  Once I had returned from the airport, I saw that he did the spec pump and calced the best way to avoid being hit.  My plan was to make him bounce so I waited for him to start failing ops on me and then I would release 8k savages or so.  I hadn't checked his most recent survey as all he did was take a land DB which proved to be the turning point - he had rezoned to 10 GNs and 10 temples which made him just able to hit me.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> After that, I just trained OP against him to make sure that he couldn't safely hit me again.  Nobody else was even close to hitting him after 12 had sunk Mac.  12 then decided to sink me as my docks were lower than 39's which meant he could safely 4:3 me again.  I just hung on for a 3rd consecutive top 5 which sucked since this was my strongest round I have ever played - but for a few mistakes.
