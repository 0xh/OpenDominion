</p><p>well, i am not such of a writer,but roundwin is a roundwin and my packies wanted from me to write smthing, and may be it will be interesting to some of u... so where to begin from .../stats [not-interesting]will be at the end/ 
First may be of wondering to play or not...ok decided to play, now with whom... First offer was from spider for 2 and I almost regged with blaf there, when he decided that we gonna play with a BG pack ... 
</p><p>and once again we almost regged when i had offer from n00b and bond, with whom we've talked to pack from a looong time ... so i was on the edge what to do ..but didnt think much. so sory to the ones i would play, i appologize once again here. And thanks to my packies *n00b,bond,papura,quendi and switch* for the great time,fun and whole round they gave to me:) 
Well i have to admit, that even i wanted to be superb round /in fact it became after that/ i made may be the weakest lyc ever. Forgot the second day DB, came OOP on 535 land instead of 580, was with 4,9k OP second wave, took 135 land, but was lucky enough that there werent any other strong lycs at all, and with predefined strategy of pumping only rats&amp;garous till 15k of the rats started to hit every 12 hours /important 12h OOP hit twice with 6k-and 7k+DP/..and hitted so till the 3-rd OOP, then a lil pum not much and again hit hit hit...until i went top. 
</p><p>At that time wonders started to appear and #62 took LoD. Pack decided we are taking it, not hearing that merf&amp;Co will beat it till the end of round and it will be endless wonder-war. nvm, we declared war and omg the next hour merf declared back...hmm, declaring mutual war to the top OP even with lair wasnt so smart move, so immediately after packies+realmies /great help from realmies too for LoD/ took Lair i was able to hit merf /top lyc in #62, second lyc attacker at that time/. 
After me and pack was on top we should care of some threats, first i hit what could in #65, after that the troll in #19 for which was a biiig cry on the msgbords and lots of pure lying, that stanioso did raze him and he was 15k under his DP. 
BS, stanioso was 1,5k under that , and i didnt need a raze at all, just had to send 2kWW more remaining on super safe DP. huh, why would organize a raze just to hit a target under my range?!? but they were goin too dangerous ..and i dun like trollz attackers going to 3k with 500 DMs at that time of the round..anyway thanks to Ross that he deleted him ... with his tiny appologoize for cross login. 
</p><p>Well i had to hit stanioso /gobo in #85/ when i could or i just had to pump 1k spec to be able to do it ..but i missed the chance ..and thats why the lyc XPlorers survived at all. After that my pack had troubles with the kobo in 85 and the FW in 74 which were really hard to keel..but at last mine bigger land/income/military had to put them on knees.We either sunk the FW in #74 
And what to retel ...after that we were just dominating all and not giving any chances ... 
The most important thing once again for the win was the information gathered...And with packies like n00b and Papura we knew everything by their TargetFinders and databases and all the ops made by them and the whole pack. Well even i can tell its not me wnining this round, but my pack on 90% and me 10% ..just pushing buttons. 
m thats from me i think its enough... Once again thanks guys for the round:)

</p><p>First off I want to apologize to all the people that I told that I would not play this round (IC, fingal, spider, ivetza, and many others). However, I would not have played if not picked up by this pack and once I was in the pack, I didn’t want anyone to know that I was in there&nbsp;:) The n00b told me back before round 34 started to keep myself available for round 35 because they were considering me for their pack. However, most everyone ended up finding out who I was, and I’m not 100% sure how… Oh well, thanks for all the funny messages and threats from the people I know&nbsp;;) "If I find out you are in 69 I am going to kill you!" or something along those lines...
</p><p>Anyway, I started out this round very slow like I usually do. Early round XP was running a scary lyc, so we gathered a quick 36 peaces. That was horrible for me, so it made me a little bit slower, not being able to hit about half the playerbase because I needed prestige&nbsp;:) Thankfully we had a war with realm 62, who had the lair at the time. That war was an instant 200+ prestige for me, 100 from the wonder and 100+ from hitting deranged, who at the time was competing for most prestigious dominion. As soon as we declared war on 62, they doubled the war back with us, so we knew that we would lose the wonder, so we changed our plans and worked out a way for us to take the lair and then have XP hit Merf all in (we sunk him heavily). XP, n00b, and Papura were all cruising along nicely, with me at the bottom of the pack behind our trolls Bond (and the other wishes to remain nameless). 
Once my diamond mines were completed I started to gain some speed and I was moving along nicely until n00b hit the 85 gobbo (Stanioso) and then Stanioso decided that he would r/r most of his lands into temples. This kept me home for an entire week at 4k land, at that point I had 48k peasants and I was actually thinking that I might have a chance to win the round, oh well. I was getting very frustrated that I couldn’t send out, yet other dominions around my size were sending out not even caring about the gobbo. At that time I had the op to hit Stanioso all in on a few separate occasions, but I wouldn’t be able to hit him out of range, so we had to wait until n00b could get the op to double him out of range. Around that point in the round I had top op outside of XP (or at least I think I did). Hitting the gobbo was the first of three hits in a row. Now people were starting to really notice me. While sitting home that week, we warred 19 and sunk their trolls and XP hit one of them and we took the ToE from them. We worked well to eliminate any threats early. After making those 3 grabs in a row I was somewhere around 70k peasants and loving it&nbsp;:) Business as usual I guess. 
</p><p>We warred 19 again and sunk the troll and DE once again, for a while to keep them down. While sinking at war with 19 I was worried that the DE or troll might try to sui me, so we had to find two hits in a row, so that I could get out of their range. I got lucky when I caught a WE spying me, I didn’t even notice they were in range, but I had 60k+ more op then they had dp, so I grabbed that WE. When I made it back safely, I noticed that the dwarf in 24 (Burnt?) had just sent out and I grabbed his ops and I saw that I could hit him when I got back from class. I had to talk it over with XP first, because he was huge and the only one in his range was the lyc explorer and he had no chance of hitting him, but he could easily hit the dwarf all in. While I was in class, they came up with a plan, where I hit the dwarf 1 minute before his troops are in and then he would still be in range of XP to hit 1 minute later all in. It worked out well, because the dwarf sent me a message that he just clicked to sui me, but he was out of range (dodged a bullet there). My favorite hits were on the people that messaged me and told me to hit other people, or the one’s where they said that my op was not nearly enough to hit them, or "I’m just checking to make sure that I will have enough dp to defend you". Apparently, they had never heard of barracks spy? Point is, don’t message people asking not to get hit, or telling them that they will not be able to hit you because you are way over-defended because if it is me, that means almost for sure that you will be hit&nbsp;;)
</p><p>I was always running on borderline defense and I would always have to draft and invest into my walls to make sure that I didn’t get hit. Other than my massive homes, my build was very poor. I had very little ore mines, not enough diamond mines, and not enough lumber yards to support my fast growth in the end (definitely not enough farms either). We all had a good laugh at the idea that I would finish top orc, but not most prestigious and for a brief period I thought it was very likely that I would not get any more prestige throughout the rest of the round&nbsp;:D I woke up 30 minutes after attacking had been disabled, otherwise I was going to drop guard and hit anyone close to my 75% range (had ~580k sendable op at that time), would have given me the win, but I am glad that XP won the round, he deserved the win more because he dominated the entire round and played one hell of a round. Congrats on the round win XP, and to our pack, it was only possible because of all of our combined efforts&nbsp;;) We managed top dominion and top realm, pwnt&nbsp;:p Oh, on a nice side-note for me, I was top dom for an entire hour, so that was exciting for me&nbsp;:p Well, I could probably keep on writing and make this already long post even longer, but I doubt that anyone will want to read it as it is now, so I am done rambling on and on. Ramble, ramble, ramble… Talk to me on msn or irc if you have any questions, I’m happy to help&nbsp;;) 
I want to thank my packies: Georgi, Marius, Rica, John, and the nameless troll. You guys kick ass and I am glad I had the opportunity to play with you all. I was really worried that I would not be able to keep up with you guys and make a complete fool out of myself and ruin my golden opportunity, thankfully that wasn’t the case&nbsp;:) And thank you for all the target help and letting me be selfish this round. If not for you guys, I wouldn’t have managed to survive&nbsp;;) Oh and thanks for all the fun conversations on irc and I’m sorry I asked so many stupid questions&nbsp;:) Oh, and I am sorry about leaving you guys behind to deal with all the pissed off people that were mad at us. And thanks to all the realmies that helped me out (Dial H for Hush, Old Dwarven City, and the others). Also, wanted to say good luck to Ivetza, I am sad to see you go and I hope that all works out well for you&nbsp;:) As for me, I am done with dominion for the time being, if I play again it won’t be until August, and I will only play then if I don’t get into the pharmacy program. Good luck to everyone else&nbsp;;) 
</p><p>Special thanks goes to my killer hero, you rocked Karnak Ezak&nbsp;;) 
</p><p>Good Bye. <br />

</p><p>Interesting trying to make a strat work without anyone understanding what i was trying to do, I will try to break it down for everyone that cares&nbsp;:P
</p><p>I realise i used a somewhat controversial build, however i tried to build/plan for what could happen during the round, not just build for max efficiency assuming there are no outside influences&nbsp;:)
</p><p>My thoughts on lyc exploreres were they always seem to get raped week 2-4 because they could not keep up with top op when the huge op pumps happen. This is the sole reason i decided to have 20% smithies until i achieved 400. I realise it is not as efficient long term, but proved very helpful when i has to pump in huge dp over short periods freeing up plat so i could still keep growing even then&nbsp;:)
</p><p>The gt's oop - All my sims involve factories, just a personal thing, i never liked high alcs in protection. Also i realised the facts would not be much use soon after oop i r/r them to gts 12 hours before oop. I never intended to build anymore until i first had my 700 d.mines, which i done&nbsp;:)
</p><p>The Forest havens - i built these in protection for a couple of reasons - the 74 havens gave me an extra 1k dp oop, freeing up a few peasants. More importantly, as i considered stealing to become a major issue they enabled me to train 650 spies before stealing bacame activated day 5 - the spies only cost 340 plat each saving me 104k plat. I was thinking of r/r havens for l/yards as needed but grew fast enough that it wasnt really an issue.
</p><p>My goals i set at the beginning of the round were just to make 8k and survive with lyc.
</p><p>I constantly watched top op, checking them often and staying at least 40k above their max suicide op.
</p><p>Last few days it was obvious i could easily go over 8k, but would not get enough land to improve past 3rd
position. I chose then to just aim to finish on exactly 8,000 acres and 1,000,000 points nw. So i
stopped building and just pumped specs til i got to 1 mil .
</p><p>Yes i did come oop on 797 acres, 9.4k dp and 53k plat/hr and am happy to give the sim to anyone who wants to see it&nbsp;:p
</p><p>Thanks to Own4ge for defending me on the boards, frankly i couldnt be bothered. I wish you would have listened more about dp during hte round as well&nbsp;;)
</p><p>Also thanks to Mr T, the other 21 lyc that deleted coz of a brain explosion causing him to think all his computer viruses were coming directly from dominion, subsuquently deleting vowing to never play again&nbsp;:(
</p><p>To expert in #69, congrats on the win you deserved it
</p>
<dl><dd>)
</dd></dl>
<p>Oh, one last thing - i had over 6k spies but released them to train dp last 36 hours to prevent anyone razing me to get hit, hence the 800k dp i had&nbsp;:p

<p>yes, I was Explorer #69&nbsp;:D Was planning to be the first explorer to win a round, but .. but .. oh well&nbsp;:P 
Forgot to say congrats to #21 lyc, he did a hell of a round. I think running those smithies he had was the only thing that made possible avoiding us whole round. Being able to pump fast when we got close to his def was a big advantage. 
Thanks again to my packies, for this awesome goodbye round. Yes, I'm done with dom, and will only come back if I'll totally fail in real life in the next 6 months. 
</p><p>Sorry for the people I offended with playah, but it was a huge pleasure for me to act the jerk role. Finally went out good&nbsp;:D But all I said about Rio was true, I have to mention this. 
Thanks to all people who played with me since I started. Thanks to Aza and Basi, from teaching me not to be such a noob, in rd 17. Thanks to Skylord and Noz for teaching me to be a top player, in rds 23-24. Also have to mention Noz's guardian angel who watched over me almost every time I was sending out underdef&nbsp;:P 
</p><p>Again, noz, papura, blackreign, switch, bond, quendi, xp, Nic, blynches, devasas, svein, arthryn, knighty, morphy, fingal, nightfox, arapau, J, stellar, BMF, Spider, Vovin, Darklady, Burebista, petrut, skylord and all the others I forgot to mention, thanks for playing with me, talking to me and being more or less friends to me. Also sorry Aisha for being such a jerk to you, I was just curious how far can I push it&nbsp;:P
