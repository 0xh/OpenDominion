<p>Here follows the roundwin story as written by Scratched.
</p>
<a name="Bedtime_Story" id="Bedtime_Story"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Bedtime Story </span></h2>
<p>Wow. Round story time. Listen up kids. Daddy got a bedtime story. 
I had told my pack (J, Zarth, DJ) last round I may miss this round due to vacation so when I got back before the round started, I didn't have a pack. There were offers from my ad on msgboards but all for Good Align. So when I saw Tetre's ad, I applied. The only advantage I saw against going random was that Tetre hated Merf, and I wanted to reply merf for his all in hit on me last round. 
</p><p>Man. Packing with Tetre is an experience. Definately different from any pack I've been in for the last 30rounds. His Lizzie wasn't bad early game but his strat was built around runaway which he didnt succeed to do with Takao hitting him. After that his inefficiency caught up with him but before that his lizzie had some funky moves. Huge Draftee defense/Early GTs/Massive dp spec training/Hitting high with Chems etc. The guts of our pack. 
</p><p>My other packmates were Rocky (Uber icer who helped me take wiz ops esp after Djem deleted), Ander and Spoox went Lizzie and Orc but both got hit bad early. Spoox and I packed 2 rounds and both rounds produced round winners!!! Doink deleted on us early after his Lyc strat got pummeled and he was on catch up after that. 
(I was their 6th after Kari deserted the pack for merf's) 
</p><p>OOPed on 534acres with a sim for 7k op. Deleted it now so I don't have the stats. I was really active so I didn't miss any vital logins. 
</p><p>12/13/2006 (OOP) 
<br />2:06:17 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Therapist of Dom Addicts (# 41) conquered 36 land from realteoh (# 39). 
<br />2:15:39 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Therapist of Dom Addicts (# 41) conquered 35 land from Minas Morgul (# 19). 
<br />2:27:57 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Therapist of Dom Addicts (# 41) conquered 43 land from J234 (# 45). 
</p><p>Crummiest OOP ever right? I sent like 2k op on each. I couldnt find any targets. Oh well. At least no one can say I farmed. 
</p><p>I hit 11hrs before my troops return. 
<br />1:45:22 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Therapist of Dom Addicts (# 41) conquered 58 land from No limits (# 45). 
</p><p>12/14/2006 
<br />4:53:03 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Therapist of Dom Addicts (# 41) conquered 56 land from Senzaiqu (# 4). 
<br />5:19:20 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Therapist of Dom Addicts (# 41) conquered 57 land from Trolls On Steriods (# 39). 
</p><p>12/15/2006 
<br />6:31:26 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Therapist of Dom Addicts (# 41) conquered 79 land from Ancient Aes Sidhe (# 14). 
</p><p>12/16/2006 
<br />7:58:13 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Therapist of Dom Addicts (# 41) conquered 76 land from Wolfies galore (# 51). 
</p><p>I trained a mix of specs and elites to keep attacking 75% whenever possible. The aim was to at least keep up with the top attackers in my pack. 
</p><p>12/18/2006 
<br />2:37:04 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Therapist of Dom Addicts (# 41) conquered 99 land from Anna Marie (# 22). 
<br />My grab on IC would be the start of a theme in my round. Smacking attackers all in when their troops return and their ares fall. ALL IN FTW! 
</p><p>12/20/2006 
<br />9:59:59 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Therapist of Dom Addicts (# 41) conquered 106 land from Mikuru Beam (# 53). 
<br />9:39:36 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Therapist of Dom Addicts (# 41) conquered 95 land from St. Helen (# 23). 
</p><p>12/23/2006 
<br />8:59:40 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Therapist of Dom Addicts (# 41) conquered 108 land from The Art of War (# 2). (2nd ALL IN hit) 
</p><p>Thats all the News I saved. After that I got busy over christmas. 
<br />Meanwhile during the round, #54 and #36 were kicking up a fuss. R/Rs here and there which we spotted early the moment their NW dropped, we saw the r/r coming esp knowing their high fact strat. It was rather obvious. 
</p><p>The beauty was that I ignored their offense and kept grabbing during the whole shabang. At this point I was leading the troll ranks by 2 grabs. Jtee(Eragon) and some others started to notice that I was going pretty fast for a troll while my aim was to lay low and pwn endgame =p 
<br />Anyway, knowing who #36, #54 and #63 are. One could predict their actions. Their offense while strong, were not pointed in my direction so I took a gamble and kept grabbing. The other key was JoshB's Lyc. I knew he had less defense than me and 4 grabs bigger so as long as his Lyc stayed safe, my land would be too. 
</p><p>Our realm took ToD early in 1 wave. Very awesome. Wished I saved that crier. All of us took it down in under 10mins. And we maintained it for pretty long till someone's multi in #69 stole it. I bet he wont fess up. He claimed to be out to ruin my round but I suspect other motives. 
</p><p>For one, none would want to war a realm with 7 Lizzies ready to sink. Even though most pple ran 5-6% Docks, its never enough esp late game. 
</p><p>Now. The kobbos in 55 weren't a big concern of mine. The theory is that as a troll, I should nature big kobbos to farm later. When I talked to J in the round, we knew that our wins depended on our targets. If J could farm Fingal, Emesel, the win was his. If I farmed the Kobbos, the win would be mine. 
</p><p>By day 25, I had already removed all Gobbos from EG range. Hitting the one in #47 all in. Only the explorer remained. 
</p><p>Now Tetre had been bugging me to hit the kobbo that at times, it was seriously irritating. Djem razing the kobbos weren't my doing. It was all Djem. I wasn't even informed before the raze and the time I hit Allegorical (Last candle #55), I hit one hour after the raze because I wasn't even around during that raze. 
</p><p>First time I hit Last Candle, the raze helped and I thought I was breakable to Emesel. But luckily Djem had Top OP at the time. 
<br />Second time I hit him, Takao had 4k Grunts incoming before my troops return. I calced it wouldnt be enough without assasination of my drafts and even then, he would have to send 213k op and leave 198k dp vs Emesel which was plain suicidal. 
<br />Nevertheless, I took his grunt training seriously and was online refreshing that whole hour. I released wiz as they assasinated but it wasnt enough. He still went ahead with the hit which resulted in him getting hit the very next hour by Emesel. (I was borderline safe vs Emesel due to Peace) 
</p><p>After that hit, I thought my round was over. I posted in council that I was giving up but it was mostly "post invasion trauma". I decided to play on to make Takao suffer. I knew it was only a matter of time before he get killed. 
<br />The one thing I did do right was to release ALL my brutes and trained continuously for 4 days. 
</p><p>The game heated up when one day during work, I logged in and noticed that Last Candle wasn't active. I got Rocky to take a Rev and found Ares off. This must be my 5th All in hit. 
</p><p>Than I found Agony with Ares off a day or two later. My 6th all in hit. Technically ALL IN since he was converting. This resulted in him deleting. Might have been the other way round. My memory fails me. 
</p><p>BGs Died, Merf's pack died. Emesel and Fingal were becoming inefficient. Takao lost his wingman Allegorical. The nails were slowly hammered into the coffin of my opponents. My main competition were #9's Troll Jiriky and J's Nox in #25. Ladeda's human in #22 would be a threat if they had a wonder. Sage in #62 wasn't as offensive with J's nox pinning him down. 
</p>
<a name="Jiriky.2FRommel_Saga" id="Jiriky.2FRommel_Saga"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Jiriky/Rommel Saga </span></h2>
<p>Last 2 weeks. #9 stole our wonder from #69. We warred them for the wonder. But Jiriky/Rommel at this point of time threatened to suicide me and told me that they would removed Fingal and farm out to me if I let them have the wonder. 
<br />I ignored the msg and pass it on the Fingal who told me that it was Rommel babysitting. Its very confusing to me since I thought I spoke to Jiriky on IRC about the incident. Ross didnt do anything about it either. We took the wonder back but not before Fingal got suicided. 
</p>
<a name="The_farming_of_Jiriky.2Frommel" id="The_farming_of_Jiriky.2Frommel"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> The farming of Jiriky/rommel </span></h2>
<p>Really funny. I didn't realize he suicided. I was talking to Flamer on MSN. He told me that Jiriky razed him. It immediately occured to me FARM OUT! 
<br />I quickly took ops and managed to send out first. I half-heartedly expected <a href="scripting.html" title="Scripting">script</a> to kick in at this point when I saw his defense but I reckoned the risk was worth it. 
</p><p>We took back ToD from #9 
<br />#9 took Obelisk from #55 
<br />#55 decided to steal lair from #62 (big mistake) 
<br />Takao got sank in a mutual war. I was laughing my bum off in council. I figured that my all in hit was coming soon. But a few days later at work, I got a msg from Rocky. TAKAO SENT OUT! 
</p><p>Bang. Another big grab. I was planning to hit him all in when he got home but he got farmed to bits. Pity. 
</p>
<a name="In_the_end" id="In_the_end"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> In the end </span></h2>
<p>In the end, it became a race against J. 
</p><p>I had no more Kobbos in EG range. No more Gobbos in RG range. 
</p><p>I turned to miserable WEs. #40 was mad spec-ed raw. #30 became my beating boy. I hit him when in EG range once. Started my spec pump than hit him 2 more times in RG range. By 8k acres I had only the miserable 90k Longbowman WE in RG range and #28's WE attacker who wouldnt send after i left EG. 
</p><p>Anyone here finding it ironic that J was the bottomfeeder early game and became a solid attacker when I was a solid attacker OOP and became a dirty bottomfeeder later? 
</p><p>Anyway, it was a close race to the end and either of us could have won. Threatening to suicide J if he sent out was a bit evil and basteedly of me. I dont know if I would have. Hitting #60 would have been a better alternative. 
</p><p>In conclusion. I like to thank Djem first. He really helped the realm a lot with razes, wonders, ops and his top OP. 
<br />2nd would be Rocky, he could have finished really well if he hadnt bounced 3 times =p. He was really on my beck at call for ops and I abused him at times i think. He also provided the realm with targets using his targetfinder. The key to any decent pack's success. 
<br />3rd would be Tetre. For being Tetre. It was amusing. *Raises a Tetre Banner* 
</p><p>Also J for being a good sport at the top. I think he let me win&nbsp;;-p 
</p><p>And my realm. Great bunch. 10 OOP attackers. 3 converters. Who can ask for more? 
</p><p>So I say. It was more luck than skill. And to Tetre who asked me for my feelings about winning? I can only say its a humbling experience filled with mixed feelings of ecstasy and relief.
