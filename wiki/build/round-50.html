<p>15 dominion realms as a compromise between 10 and 20. Similar to last round, it was won by a mid-round runaway with converters filling out most of the top 10. This was the second time Emesel earned the victory, both times with his packie, Rommel, finishing second. There was also a new record for largest firewalker.
</p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Roundwin_story"> Roundwin story </span></h1>
<p>Round 50 was won by a mid-round double runaway, who finally took control after outlasting a bunch of inefficient attackers. The immediate threat at OOP was realm #45, who was bombarded with peaces right off the bat. At their peak, they held the top five strongest attackers and the playerbase was afraid this would be the fastest runaway ever. Before the peaces could full slow them down, two others rose to the top and kept the round interesting. MeggaMortY, a spec/modwhoring lizzie and Mav3ricK the token kobbo converter. While Mav's 4:3 forced attackers to stay home, it was Morty that became the largest threat. His constant stream of specs seemed endless as his income dropped to nothing. The third and final threat of the round was emesel's Spirit who's more efficient strategy kept him in the game long enough to simply outgrow Morty's liz. Not far behind emesel was Rommel's dwarf who reached the top 10 for the first tim on day 14 once and began to shine once all the other oop attacking good dominions had been taken care of. He became the top threat himself on day 25 and shared that honor with emesel for eleven days before holding the distinction on his own for the rest of the round.
</p><p><br />My flash drive broke at the start of the round so unfortunately I can't comment on the first two weeks. So, starting at week three!

<p><br />Day 31: #33, #41 and #30 all warred #16 to FB the top guys and take down the ToB.
<br />Day 32: With no attackers able to send vs #16, they trained huge OP forcing the warring realms to scramble to stay defended. Meanwhile, they trained huge spies and wiz to avoid black ops.
<br />Day 33: With #16 proving to be unstoppable, Spart and Champ couldn't see any way to keep up their dp without getting smacked so they both deleted. Spart's land size would have been good for 29th place if he could have sat untouched for 17 days.

<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id=".2316.27s_Story"> #16's Story </span></h1>
<p>First of all, a lot of people were whining about Rommel having an easy time because there were no good "good" attackers. This is absolutely not true. There were good attackers, but the guys took them out so there weren't any more. A part from Takao, where we were really lucky that he left! He looked really scary.

<p><b>The Tiny Kneebiters (# 46)</b><br /> 
Was in a mediocre shape at that time, but would have surely become an issue in the end. sent out a bit light and that was the result:

He was really looking good at that time, good build, good peasants, nice imps. But he made a few mistakes when sending out lightly and then not casting the spell all-in.

7:59:35 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Priapus (# 16) conquered 98 land from Black Whirling (# 26).
</p><p><b>Genocidal Nature (# 48)</b><br /> 
He was the worst of all early on, we kinda missed him first because he was spec-whoring. At a certain point he was close to breaking either MSL or Rommel but with a bit of luck and drafting up nothing happened. But something had certainly to be done about him. He had huge offense at that time and was dumping spec OP like mad. Lucky for us that he didn't have enough docks and spies to protect his troops. So we waited for MSL, Rommel and Mac to get home first and then we warred and sank him (thanks to bobbo and Che).

</p><p>He got invaded by several big doms at that time, but bobbo finished him off for us&#160;:P
</p><p><b>J H O N (# 32)</b><br /> 
Was also a bigger problem for our dwarves, even for MSL, seeing as he had suicidal tendencies.
I can't remember who JHON hit, but when he did he left himself very light. BAM (#31) hit him first and Rommel followed up. After coming back in, he was starving, suicided again and got destroyed by other top doms.

<p>Mac and Bobbo did an awesome job at killing off potential good competition!

- firewalker in #2<br /> 
- sylvan in #10<br /> 
</p><p>Lucky thing that Takao (<i>What Im doing here again (#46)</i>) deleted, he would have been a real problem, but we would have tried anything to prevent that&#160;:P But we'd have been a lot more busy then!<br /> 
E in #30 was also quite strong late round, but due to 4:3 Rommel had to train defense anyways, so it wasn't as bad as that. We were also watching the converters in #12 veeeery closely&#160;;)

</p><p>Town Crier at 8/1/2008<br /> 
6:59:38 PM Sadly, the forces of Dionysus (# 16) were beaten back by BAM (# 31).<br /> 
(Some miscalculation from our side maybe, even if we all got the same result independently and oversent by 3k or so. BAM left himself light, so did MSL. But it was of no consequences (apart from the bounce for Mav) for both.)

<p>We didn't really know what happened there. #41 had decided to take it on us since OOP when we weren't even holding top OP. They screwed over Macros completely by hitting him (1 OOP hit for 5k, come on...) and FBing/sinking him later on. They also knocked ToB back to #0, where #28 got a lucky hit and destroyed it. At that time we couldn't cancel war as we had still 1 day left with #41 (they didn't lose CoG (?) in time).<br /> 
Anyways, as soon as we could we declared on #28 and #42 nearly snatched it from us, but Mac closed the deal by getting it&#160;:)

<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Sauce.27s_Story"> Sauce's Story </span></h1>
<p>What an awesome round this was! My goal was to go for back to back exploring wins, top 10s or 7k finishes. I didn't think this was a realistic goal since I expected kobbos to fly and finish over 8k again. At first I couldn't decide between Sylvan, who I felt was the best race, or Firewalker, who also looked strong despite no one ever succeeding with them. After speaking with Dreki, we decided that a 7k Sylvan explorer wouldn't impress anyone but a 7k FW would. I decided to sim both races and after achieving an 802 acre FW sim with 56k plat/hr I really had no choice but to play it.  
<br />I got off to a fast start as expected running only 800 specs or so and the rest elites. By day 8 I had hit 100k plat/hr and was only slightly behind Sparticus, a very speedy kobbo running Mav3ricK's strat from 2 rounds ago. Spart's goal was to beat Mav's finish by training less dp and ignoring 4:3 of top doms. By the end of week two, I had the highest income at 187.5k plat/hr despite being behind Spart by 243 acres. Here's the breakdown of my plat production: 
<br />Day 8: 100k plat/hr
<br />Day 17: 200k plat/hr
<br />Day 25: 300k plat/hr
<br />Day 27: 100m total plat prod
<br />Day 39: 200m total plat prod
<br />Day 40: 400k plat/hr
<br />Day 49: 300k total plat prod
<br />Weeks 3-4 was met with blazing speed as realms wrestled for control at the top. None of them could touch me or Spart however. On day 22, Spart became the fastest explorer in at least the last 10 rounds to reach 4k. What made me feel good was I was only 22 hours behind the fastest explorer in recent history. Spart hit 5k six days later, however that's where things would change. Rommel and Emesel were the only top tier attackers that had builds designed to last the entire round. It was clear they were gonna run with this and Spart decided to war them to try to slow them down. A few other realms joined in recognizing this was their last opportunity to stop a runaway. Rommel and Emesel did a nice job of catching this in time and trained plenty of spies and wiz to cover the threat. As a result of losing peace and having a war declaration, Spart and Champ both slowed down drastically and began training tons of dp in an attempt to prevent themselves from being hit. I was in the process of training wizards so that I could join in the festivities but I stopped once I saw how badly #33 and #41 were getting messed up. It soon became clear that Champ was going to get hit, he was 700 acres behind and didn't have the economy to continue training underlings. Day 33: Spart deleted first (5,565 acres) knowing that he had no chance to survive the round without feeding the runaways. Champ deleted a few hours later (4,734 acres). I was 110 acres behind Spart and closing fast when he deleted but now it left me with a 1,112 acre lead over the next largest explorer, which I would build upon over the rest of the round.
<br />Initially, my income was so high that I had no problem training enough dp to keep up with the double runaway threat. I was the first player to 6k on day 36 and I still hadn't unleashed my secret weapon, GTs. The plan was to hit day 40 and explore for GTs for the rest of the round, as I quickly found out, I still needed to train units to avoid behind hit. OP was growing so fast and at one point I needed to train 4 out of every 5 hours just to stay ahead of Rommel's 4:3. In round 46, I was faced with a similar situation where I was the top explorer facing a triple runaway; I was finally taken down after getting snared. I was afraid that would happen again this round but #16 never declared on us. The suppose that my realm (#2 largest overall) didn't have a wonder and if #16 warred us, we would have grabbed it before I could get snared. Either way, I'm glad I never had to face that situation this time around. With a week to go, I realized that I could become the largest explorer ever if I explored 10 out of every 12h after construction costs. It seemed doable at the time figuring Rommel would start to bf his warriors and I could freely explore. He never did that though and only made one hit in the final week. By the end of the round, my income had dipped to about 390k and I was unfortunately forced to sit on 680k mod dp. 8,151 acres is still a hell of a finish with a double runaway and in most other rounds I think I would have finished over 9k. One interesting thing to note is that in rd48, on day 37, top op was 297k; this round, top op was 421k. I'm not sure where top op finished in rd48, but Rommel's ending offense was 634k with 10% reduction.
<br />I accomplished all my goals and then some this round. 8,151 is my biggest finish yet and gives me back to back 7ks. This is the biggest Firewalker finish by a whopping 716 acres and the first time a FW has finished top three. I've now been top explorer with three different races, done it in back to back rounds and three out of four of my last attempts. That one failure wasn't too shabby either but unfortunately faced the biggest runaways i ever remember in Rio/Ladeda/Fingal. I do realize that exploring isn't nearly as difficult as attacking, but being the best at that particular strat three times is enough to make me proud. It was a fun round and I'll always remember it.
