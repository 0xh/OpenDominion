<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Overview"> Overview </span></h2>
<p>A good protection is not required to have a fun and good round, but it can definitely give you a great start. Many people <a href="simulators.html" title="Simulators">simulate</a> on beforehand to make up a plan for protection. There is no single good way of doing this, but something in common for most good protections and strategies is to not build <a href="buildings.html#Mod_buildings" title="Buildings">mod buildings</a> during protection (or at all, early in the round). The only time mod buildings OOP are useful is for high-speed strategies.
</p><p>To leave protection is called "going OOP" where <i>OOP</i> stands for <i>Out of Protection</i>.
</p><p>It can be argued that protection is only marginally important to how successful your round result is going to be. 
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Waves"> Waves </span></h2>
<p>The waves serve two purposes: to give people a chance to vary their protection depening on timezone and strategy and to relieve the server of the strain of pushing everyone OOP at the same time. Waves are assigned randomly and only players with a <a href="premium-account.html" title="Premium account">premium account</a> have the ability to choose a wave. Below is a table of the waves and their differences.

<p>Generally speaking, waves 1, 2, 3 and 4 are the most common for attackers. Wave 5 does not hold a characteristic for anything. And for wave 6, while it is the best wave for explorers because you start with the most resources out of the 6, it is not favored by attackers because many of the juiciest targets will be gone by then. However, as always, this naturally varies on one's strategy. Some attackers pick a later wave and go OOP at a higher landsize instead of an earlier wave and lower landsize.
</p><p>Usually wave one is best for attackers, because you can search for targets 6 hours in a row and therefore easier find big, fat land defense dominions (the dominions whose defense is so low, that the formula of 1.5* land + defensive bonuses results in a higher dp and thus is used) or dominions with generally low defense.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Examples"> Examples </span></h2>
<p>Here are some examples of a good protection. You can find real simulations on the <a href="simulations.html" title="Simulations">simulations</a> page.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Example_.231"> Example #1 </span></h3>
<p>This is a very rough outline for a decent protection. It has a lot of room for improvement and variation.
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Hour 0:</b> Build 25 Towers (this will give you enough mana to cast spells at hour 12), 15 Temples (for population growth), 40 Factories and, if your race needs them, 20 Docks. Set 90% draftrate.
</li><li> <b>Hour 2-6:</b> Explore 29 acres of plains, whenever you can afford.
</li><li> <b>Hour 12:</b> Build 20 Ore Mines and 40 Alchemies (if your race does not need ore, build 60 Alchemies). Cast Harmony.
</li><li> <b>Hour 13:</b> Cast Midas Touch. Take <a href="daily-bonus.html" title="Daily bonus">daily landbonus</a> and, if needed, rezone to plains and build 20 Alchemies.
</li><li> <b>Hour 14-20:</b> As soon as your first batch of explored land comes, build 29 Alchemies.
</li><li> <b>Hour &lt;24:</b> Whenever you last hour of your first day is, take your platinum bonus and explore as many acres of plains as possible. It should be somewhere around 90-110 acres. Build Alchemies on these acres.
</li><li> <b>Hour 24:</b> Cast Midas Touch, Harmony and, if needed, Mining Strength. Take daily bonus and build 20 Homes.
</li><li> <b>Hour 24-36:</b> Explore as much as you can during these hours. For almost all races, you will benefit the most if you make all of these acres plains and build Alchemies (although you will need to increase the amount of Towers to afford spells later on). Make sure that you by hour 36 have enough plains incoming to cover full Smithies (18% or 20%). Mathematically speaking: <b>(Landsize)/0.8</b> (for 20% Smithies, <b>/0.82</b> for 18% Smithies and <b>/0.85</b> for 15% Smithies) should be less than or equal to your amount of incoming acres of plains.
</li><li> <b>Hour 36:</b> Cast Midas Touch, Harmony and, if needed, Mining Strength. If you are done exploring, take daily landbonus and use it to build Smithies.
</li><li> <b>Hour 36-48:</b> Build the Smithies now. You either build them gradually up to hour 48 or you can build them all hour 48. This way you will have full Smithies by hour 60.
</li><li> <b>Hour 48:</b> Cast Midas Touch, Harmony and, if needed, Mining Strength.
</li><li> <b>Hour 48-54:</b> Keep track of your peasants now. The very hour you see that the number of peasants decrease instead of increase - take your daily platinum bonus. (Preferably take it the hour before peasants decrease.)
</li><li> <b>Hour 60:</b> Train elite units (the two more expensive ones). Cast Midas Touch and, if needed, Mining Strength. Harmony isn't really needed now.
</li><li> <b>Hour 63:</b> Train specialist units (the two cheaper ones).
</li><li> <b>Hour 72:</b> Out of protection!
</li></ul>
<p>Doing this will give you a pretty good OOP. Variations are most effective if done the first few hours. You can go with 17 Towers and 19 Temples instead, doing which you will save land for other buildings at the cost of not being able to cast Harmony until hour 13 and Midas Touch hour 14. Make sure that you don't have explored acres incoming hour 13 or 14 then, as the mana cost will increase then and you will lose an hour of spells (although this is a viable way to do it).
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Example_.232"> Example #2 </span></h3>
<p>This is an example of an explorer OOP-strat. This example differs from Example #1 on a few points.
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Hour 0:</b> Build 15 Towers, 15 Temples, and 56 Factories (then you'll have top bonus at 299 acres.) Set 90% draftrate.
</li><li> <b>Hour 2-6:</b> Explore 29 acres of plains, whenever you can afford.
</li><li> <b>Hour 12:</b> Build 20 Ore Mines and 40 Alchemies (if your race does not need ore, build 60 Alchemies). Cast Harmony.
</li><li> <b>Hour 13:</b> Cast Midas Touch. Take daily landbonus and, if needed, rezone to plains and build 20 Alchemies.
</li><li> <b>Hour 14-20:</b> As soon as your first batch of explored land comes, build 29 Alchemies.
</li><li> <b>Hour &lt;24:</b> Whenever your last hour of your first day is, take your platinum bonus and explore as many acres of plains as possible. It should be somewhere around 90-110 acres. Build Alchemies on these acres.
</li><li> <b>Hour 24:</b> Cast Midas Touch, Harmony and, if needed, Mining Strength. Take daily bonus and build 20 Homes.
</li><li> <b>Hour 24-36:</b> Explore as much as you can during these hours. Build as much Alchemies as you can.
</li><li> <b>Hour 36:</b> Cast Midas Touch, Harmony and, if needed, Mining Strength. If you are done exploring, take daily landbonus and use it to build Smithies.
</li><li> <b>Hour 36-48:</b> Build the Smithies now. You either build them gradually up to hour 48 or you can build them all hour 48. This way you will have full Smithies by hour 60.
</li><li> <b>Hour 48:</b> Cast Midas Touch, Harmony and, if needed, Mining Strength.
</li><li> <b>Hour 48-54:</b> Keep track of your peasants now. The very hour you see that the number of peasants decrease instead of increase - take your daily platinum bonus. (Preferably take it the hour before peasants decrease.)
</li><li> <b>Hour 60:</b> Train elite units (the two more expensive ones). Casift Midas Touch and, needed, Mining Strength. Harmony isn't really needed now.
</li><li> <b>Hour 63:</b> Train specialist units (the two cheaper ones).
</li><li> <b>Hour 72:</b> Out of protection!
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Example_.233"> Example #3 </span></h3>
<p>First tip: use the <a href="http://www.igalaxie.com/~blackreign/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Blackreign Excel Simulator</a>! In this simulator you can instantly see the effect of what you are doing so you can easily tweak it a bit.
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Hour 0: </b>Build 17 Towers (this will give you enough mana to cast Harmony at hour 13 and Midas Touch at hour 15), 15-30 Temples (for population growth) and 56 Factories (for cheaper building cost). You have to rezone acres to do this (36 acres to Hills and 8-23 to Swamp) Caverns and Forest are most suitable (if your race doesn’t need Ore or Boats you can also use Mountain or Water) You can also destroy some Homes or Lumber Yards (max 10-15) for the remaining acres you need. Set draftrate to 90%. Release all your troops to draftees. Do <b>not</b> release the draftees.
</li><li> <b>Hour 0-xx: </b>Explore 29 acres of Plains, whenever you can afford.
</li><li> <b>Hour 12: </b> Time to build! 20 Ore Mines if you race needs Ore otherwise rezone the Mountains to Plains. 15+ Docks if your race needs them. If you haven’t already destroyed some Lumber Yards destroy 10-15 (so you end up with 10-15 of them) and rezone them to Plains, same goes for Homes. Destroy 10-20 Farms. Take daily landbonus and, if needed, rezone to Plains. Build all those barren Plains with Alchemies. Build your incoming explored Plains also with Alchemies
</li><li> <b>Hour 13: </b>Cast Harmony.   
</li><li> <b>Hour  15: </b>Cast Midas Touch
</li><li> <b>Hour 25: </b>Cast Midas Touch, Harmony and, if needed, Mining Strength.    
</li><li> <b>Hour 25-36: </b>Explore as much as you can during these hours. For almost all races, you will benefit the most if you make all of these acres plains and build Alchemies. Make sure that you by hour 36 have enough plains incoming to cover full Smithies (18% or 20%). Mathematically speaking: (Landsize you will come OOP with)*0.2 (for 20% Smithies and *0.18 for 18% Smithies). You will need some extra Towers too so also explore some Swamp (8-15 acres). You’ll also need to build some extra farms (10-20 depending how many you destroyed and what race you are) to prevent starving when you are out of protection, however build Alchemies first the farms can wait a couple of hours! Some races also need some more Ore Mines so they will need to explore some extra Mountains. You can explore some acres after this but it’ll cost you more draftees per acre, if you are planning on doing so don’t explore more than 120 acres in your first batch and don’t explore for a couple of hours after that so you can explore some more acres at 419 acres (at 5 draftees/acre).
</li><li> <b>Hour 36: </b>Cast Midas Touch, Harmony and, if needed, Mining Strength. If you are done exploring, take daily landbonus and either build them as Homes or Alchemies. If you are not done exploring yet explore the extra acres you want (Note that exploring Plains for Smithies  after this hour is useless because they'll come in too late, however you could explore Swamp for Towers and Plains for Farms at this time).
</li><li> <b>Hour 36-48: </b>Build the Smithies now. You either build them gradually up to hour 48 or you can build them all hour 48. This way you will have full Smithies by hour 60. (Best way is to build them every time you get your acres in).
</li><li> <b>Hour 48: </b>Cast Midas Touch, Harmony and, if needed, Mining Strength. Take daily land bonus and build Homes (can be done later too, this is the first hour you can take it since it is a new day now). 
</li><li> <b>Hour 48-54: </b>Keep track of your peasants now. The very hour you see that the number of peasants decrease instead of increase - take your daily platinum bonus. (Preferably take it the hour before peasants decrease or see your sim when your peasants are maxed out and take it at that time).
</li><li> <b>Hour 60: </b>Train elite units (the two more expensive ones) and some spies and wizards (30-50 of both types is enough). Cast Midas Touch and, if needed, Mining Strength. Harmony isn't really needed now.
</li><li> <b>Hour 63: </b>Train specialist units (the two cheaper ones)
</li><li> <b>Hour 64+:</b> keep training extra defense so your "12 hours out" DP is solid; should be around 6-7,000.
</li><li> <b>Hour 72: </b>Out of protection! Time to attack!
</li></ul>
<p>This is a slightly more 'hardcore' way of simming and it requires you to be pretty active (at least at the right times).
