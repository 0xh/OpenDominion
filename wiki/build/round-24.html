</p><p>I started attacking at end of week 2, still in time to find big underdef suicidal dudes with ~14K def on 800-850 acres, i made use very efficiently of the 9 hrs returning cavalry, kept smithies to 40% until 3K acres, and made several row of 3-4 big hits, like 90-120% until I got in top 20 and started attracting attention on me.
</p><p>At some point I got into emesel's range by 2 acres, but I was after the second hit in the row, and my op started to suck. At that time emesel was really needing to hit, and he grabbed rocky, then took land bonus to get away from my range. I took my own bonus and got back in his range, and started to spy him, he was having 192K mod def, and I had like 170K max sendable non-suicide op, and decided to not suicide on him, but he already peaced me meanwhile. I was surprised, cuz he knew harmonius explored to get in his range and grab his ass, and the rest of the story is already known. I made an another hit in AJ's realm fast, to have cavalry back before Emesel, Harm and Ed had troups back home, and got close to 4K acres.
</p><p>After that, I mass built GNs, about 15%, retrained op and started to make def. By the time I was planning to start attacking again, I lost my internet connection and I had to go to an internet cafe the whole weekend each 2-3-4 hrs, to check how things are going and find the right moment to hit. That weekend icers in #171 started to be scary too, but they were after some hits and I assumed they are retraining wpa/op, peaced Ed and hit one fat icer to get more land for GNs. in 9 ticks, I found another fat icer, grabbed his ass again, and said "wow, nice, more GNs for me without rezone", and got out from Ed's range. Sunday night I got my internet back, and lurked for a third target, and my realmies got ops on the #200 liz, which was way underdef, but i had no troups home at that time. In the morning I got my own ops on him, right before hour change, he was havign like few more def than I could send, and decided to look for another target after hourchange, when I spot a land drop on him (Harmonius hit him), so I retook castle spy for his imps and made my hit too, and become #1 dom with about 5200 acres. I made 20% GNs, made some rax to fix my pop and started retraining until last week, on monday, when I started hitting again, but my op wasn't even close to top op anymore. I made some smaller hits, grabbed about 800-900 acres withing the 75% range and started building shrines. When I got my first 4%, I declared bottomfeeding open, and started to make lame hits due to my sucky op. Was really painfull, considering that I had to start training fast spec op/def due to sucky income. I was planning to take advantage of the 9 hrs return troups, and make one hit at RG limit with only cavalry, and second hit bigger, with sending out spearmen again. Of course, I couldn't do that cuz AJ, Don, Harm and Thomjo started having way more op than my def with all cavalry out, so I chose to make smaller hits with keeping max cavalry home. I luckily found a troll in Justice's realm who did a sui, grabbed some nice acres, then watched for Neophyte to suicide, as I was certain he will do it, grabbed his acres too, and then last 12 attacking hours began. Was really stressing, almost everyone could have hit me on full send, I carefully watched until Harm bounce on the fat kobo, AJ farming again mikau and Don slaughtering thomjo, and at that point only Lorian or his troll could have hit me with semi-suid, declared peace on them and took my hit on the fat kobo to get over 8K acres. I made 40 hits this round, had 7 heroes, but they starting to die like fleas when I started bottomfeeding with shrines in the last week =)
</p><p>The story is kinda short, didn't fit in it all struggle I had to keep my ass safe and be able to grow. Anyway, thanks to Noz for her being a great packmate, to Arthryn for declaring on me to take the Spire and to Sonic Death for not suiciding on me as he let me think he'll do at some point&nbsp;:P
</p><p>I had lotsa fun while getting peaced/peacing AJ, he was the one who always kept an eye on me, I think at some points he was knowing even when I go to pee and what I plan to eat at breakfast, but no one was listening him when he was telling things about me on irc =)
___
I must add that when I got to 4K i had to chose from making GNs and try to runaway, or making DMs and grow slower. Same time ross nerfed FBs, but not before I trained like 1K AM getting my wpa close to 1. Some peple were really annoyed about my wpa, and asked if I did that on purpose to make it impossbile to cast 10 clearsights or so to find my closest acurate troups. It was pure luck, nothing planned, lol&nbsp;:)
Scratch and the gang already started to mention laming people with LBs, so it wasn't hard for me to decide, after some long discussions with Skylord and Noz, to go for GNs and keep my ass safe from DEs. 
</p><p>I also had like 200 docks at 4K acres, which was good enough to protect my boats, and I was ready all the time to make more if I had any sign some nasty lamers will want to sink me, as that was the only thing they could do. I was already getting used with 24/7 swarms. mickles and scratch started swarming me and I stayed like 24 hrs with 1-2K food and changing ore for food each hour, then decided to make 0.5% more farms and solve the problem =)
</p><p>In the end AJ told me that 100 DMs would have been my most profitable buildings, and he was right, but after seeing everyone saying "hummie is dead" "hummie can't hit anymore, it's amazing he did even the hits he did", "no imps killed him" and such sort of things, last thing I would have done was to build DMs as I wanted to prove myself I can survive even with them. Yea, the donkeyhead in me has spoken. =)
