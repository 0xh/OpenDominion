<a name="Roundwin_Story" id="Roundwin_Story"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline"> Roundwin Story </span></h1>
<p>Having not played dominion for quite a while besides creating an account out of boredom every now and then, I had a niggling feel that I may want to play a round one day or another. The comeback kept having to be put back as round after round I had no time to play due to a multitude of causes until this one fitted perfectly into my timetable. I had asked around quite late on if anybody was packless just as the previous round finished and found that most of the packs had already been formed and it seemed unlikely I would get something until somehow purpledino (dino) got hold of me with an offer to pack himself, sephonly (seph), vanzant (luka), faith and Scotty.
</p><p>On paper the pack looked very solid and I was very happy to join in. At this stage I did not want anybody to know I was playing. Hence a new player appeared under the name of p0rc. This was the guy they took into their pack based only on words that he is not too bad and will do his best. The alter ego was born. At this stage we began discussing our strategy for the round. Luka and Scotty were convinced that Halfling will own this round and I agreed that this would be the case. The one major counter argument I saw was that if we went as good alignment, the other 4 slots in the pack would be hard to choose. Gnome seemed strong, but we weren't sure how the late-round power of Suicide Squads would be affected by the changes. Firewalker seemed quite good (I am still surprised nobody did really well with them) but overall Evil alignment meant we could have a more balanced pack overall. All of us except faith talked on MSN as faith is clearly not technologically advanced enough to get one&nbsp;:) and here I came out with the bomb.
</p><p>I wanted to play undead. My pack as well as most of the people on IRC told me the Undead sux, but looking at the changes I saw them to be given an insane boost. Obviously teching was pointless as getting all those techs actually made Undead a worse race as you would save less money on the vampire conversions at 75% than full progeny. The new conversion rule for hits over half your size stared out to me from the changes. I was told time and time again that bottomfeeding is too expensive and that it is impossible to do well but I decided against it and went as Undead. Dino, Scotty and Seph went fast with the first two picking lizzie and Seph taking goblin. Faith went as a converting Kobold. None of us knew why except possibly faith himself and Scotty chose to convert a Nox, which seemed also to be very strong with the elite getting a huge boost for OP.
</p><p>Round started off quite well with a lively bunch of nubs in the council and one guy, who did quite well early on until he got hit down. This was IcemanAragorn. A great 7th packmate as he was always willing to get ops and hit down every wonder we needed. Protection went pretty much to plan. Just like the rest of the round I had sleep encorporated into my strat from midnight til 8:45am as I saw no point in not sleeping for a slightly better strat. The round is 50 days long for a reason&nbsp;:) I came oop on 625 acres with 4k OP and 5k DP (including some specs for defence) on wave 6. My strat was highly unusual and was very similar to what #38 ended up doing for the first day oop. I made one hit very soon after the hour change for around 40 acres. I was happy because I had 3k OP left and I only expected to make 3 hits anyway. After this hit, my net went down for about 5 minutes. I came back on and saw no targets whatsoever. I got mad and looked for higher people, easily finding some guy on pretty decent acres for 3k and hit him for 80. This gave me a total gain of 125 acres oop.
</p><p>Straight after these hits, I explored for 9-10 hours until land arrived, building a little DP as I went along. This put me on around 870 acres or so and I began hitting every 12 hours. At first I could easily hit in 75% and was growing nicely in the early days. On day 7 I was on 1135 acres with nice OP and was hitting quickly. Sephonly trained very nice OP and was close to when not top OP. This protection helped a lot with my speed, but the worst was yet to come when the suiciders turned up. #35, #11 and #66 were all dangerous with a few other threats around. It was very hard to keep an eye on all of them as #11 trained suicidal OP and I kept a check on them until #35 goblin hit me on day 10 for 150 acres when I totally missed his OP pump. That knocked me right out of the leading group. I was devastated. My economy went dead and my OP was not enough to make really big hits. I was going to delete right there and then. My pack talked to me and after a lot of persuasion they talked me into staying if only to chat to and make me be an ops bitz. So I began trying to regain some land and began hitting every 12 again. On one of these sends, 1 hour after I sent, we got ops on MushMush, a fairly small Lizardfolk, who had low NW and full mods. As by this point I made it back into top 20, it was rather worrying that he could have hit me for 11 hours. Instead he chose to hit somebody smaller and I was lucky that time.
</p><p>I kept sitting on the edge of the top 10 right up until the point when Harm (Chaos #38) emerged and #11 trained insane OP. At this stage #38 began all working for Harm's win. Every goblin who posed a threat was sunk one by one and I began training Wizards as I was afraid of being fireballed to death by his pack as another obvious contender. #11 did not really pose much threat to me as I concentrated on keeping solid defence and I had to defend Harmonius also. Here we began playing cat and mouse. It became clear that the battle was between him and I and we began training just to match the other. On one of my sends, I checked Harmonius about 20 minutes into the hour and saw that he had spent his platinum and therefore I was safe from a spec drop. 2 minutes before the hour change. I checked his BS again just to make sure and to my horror he trained huge specs with his daily platinum bonus and possibly other resources converted into plat. He clearly saw that I also spent my platinum and was going to hit me the hour before my troops arrived. Funnily enough next time he checked me he saw that I had also taken my daily platinum bonus that hour and trained enough specs that very same hour by releasing some spies. After 9 hours of investing every resource I had in my castle, I was safe by a matter of 100 DP or so. This was the closest it came.
</p><p>I have to say that the Realm I played in had some of the most amazing nubs I have ever had the chance to play with. These guys who sit around 1k land for most of the round hit every wonder we asked for and were generally an awesome bunch. We are talking 500k worth of damage to a wonder in 24 hours in early round without a single big dominion hitting it. This allowed us to take down the Temple of the Damned a couple of times and the Great Wall, all of which were then taken away from us. It seemed everybody wanted to take our wonder from us instead of possibly depriving stronger Realms like #65 or #38 of their wonders at the time.
</p><p>As Harm grew very strong I figured that he will drop guard to bottomfeed to get very big acres and sit there. This is why I entered the EG and began training OP. As I could not possibly hit anything in EG prior to getting the OP I needed, I began razing. This happened around the time when Harm was suspended and I razed #38 halfling, #65 halfling and I think #14 halfling (can't remember for sure
</p><p>This slowed them all down considerably as they were the strongest halfers at the time and I saw Halfling as my biggest threat as getting ops on them proved almost impossible.
</p><p>As Harm and then Rommel were suspended, I found myself suddenly having incredible spare DP and way more OP than anybody in the game. I had around 190k OP easily sendable while nobody else had over 145k. This enabled me to grow very rapidly by hitting everybody who sent out. Soon obviously more efficient races caught up and I just began bottomfeeding. I hit in 50% whenever I could, but was not too sad to hit in 40%, which gave a minimum of around 100 land per hit towards the end of the round, which made growth easy.
</p><p>Another interesting part of this round was the abundance of wonder wars. Temple of the Damned came out fairly early and we knew we wanted to get it. We didn't have the necessary OP between us so to make sure we began looking around. We noticed one Dark Elf hitting the wonder every 12 hours and calculated the OP sent. Then we systematically went through about 80% of all the evil realms and got their CVs to check who is attacking and how much they are sending. After this we calculated that we should just about have enough OP to hit the wonder down. We were all online, preparing the order of hits and about to hit before hour change when Dino just sent at the wonder and took it down in one hit. This is where #43 became a real pain in the back. They decided that nothing can stop them from having our wonder. So they warred us for it. After we retook it, they spent a few days taking it down again even though it slowed them all down to the point where they could no longer compete with the top realistically. We then decided to take down the Great Wall as #60 looked ominous only for them to take that right back too. After all this, we were wonderless for a while until I messaged dino before going to sleep one night that I want the Portals. Sure enough war was declared when I woke up and the Portals were taken by the time I came back from the weekend off.&nbsp;:)
</p><p>My favourite moment of the round came unexpectedly. I was sitting without a target after entering the EG. My OP was quite low and I did a prem search at xx:59:10 at which point I saw that #65 (I think) halfer It's my precious sent out. I then took his CS, put it into Talium's (conveniently open), added 15% GT and 5% walls (quite a bit for that time in the round) and saw I was 4k OP clear. Then I msged dino saying 'O.o I am gonna blind this guy. Yay or nay?' After getting a shrug response I blind sent and got about 400 acres, my biggest hit of the round. That made me smile for sure.
</p><p>All in all for the second half of the round I just kept hitting every 9-12 hours and grew at a rate of around 300 land per day, which could not be matched by any of the other attackers. Knighty came very close at the end and had he not been away for 4 days it could have been a lot closer, but in the end he had to defend a number of suicidal people and wasn't able to hit for big acres in the last few days. I also missed 4 days of the round the weekend before Knighty did and lost ~6-7 million platinum then, but it didn't matter too much in the end.
</p><p>I would like to give thanks to my Realm, who did all they could for me to win, including taking down wonders and getting ops (thanks to Paxercise for full ops on Halflings early round, which let me hit big Halflings others couldn't get ops on) and my Special thanks goes to Iceman, Dino and Luka, who stayed with me til end round and murdered their chams for an insane number of ops that I asked them to get.&nbsp;:) Thanks to Sephonly for protecting me in early round by pumping top OP while letting me keep hitting and thanks to faith, who before going inactive trained all his peons into spies and got me full ops on all the top halfers, which meant I had a vague idea about their builds and was able to send out a lot more OP than I otherwise would have.
</p><p>----------
</p><p>In short, I fell asleep on the keyboard, my face was mashing the keyboard for the last 50 days. I woke up now and a dom winner. Whoah!
