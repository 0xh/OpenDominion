</p><p>Honestly this looks like the worst round-winner account ever&nbsp;:P
</p><p>But may be this can be explain by the fact i was hited five times and have been blackoped around 10 days in the midle of the round when my race is most powerfull and exactly when my strategy with 600 dms constructed so early was going to take effect on my peons , if i remember right i was with 90k peasant population when i was at 4500 land but realm 8 keep my peasants around 50k and i never feel the advantage from my bigger peasant population. Anyway , about the round win story may be it`s better to wait when XP come back from England next month and together we will write the whole story because if i write it by my own you will understand only the half because my english is worst almost same like my account&nbsp;:P
</p><p>Thnx to everyone for good words but i`m really far away from the mind this was the greatest round win ever. Honestyle it looks like the worst round win ever , there were a lot of important decision to be taken and only the luck help me to win this round.
When i bounced and getting hitted the same hour i lose around 70k op and 20k dp and i just shut off everything and trying to get some sleep , but i was too nervous to falling asleep so i start the computer and was going to sent my account in away mode , then i noticed someone hit the fw and i just can`t belive it but i still think then the FW did a mistake by hitting back 31 because this move bring me back in the game. Realm 8 did everything and they had bigger chance to win in any one moment. When my strategy with fast DM`s starting to take effect and my gob was starting to running great , they already was kill the rest of attackers so the only thing i had to do was to find a way to beat them. Even it`s become a more interesting and personal for me when i uderstand merf is messed up , we have a many battles in the past with him so may be this was provoke me more than all to give my best.Honestly i starting this round unmotivating just to be IN and wachting around. I did the worst protection ever and leaving at 550 land , around 4k op and 4k dp. I even didn`t halucinate about the round win.. i was already pissed of because the last round i played i did great accounts with great sims but i miss every single chance to win the round and i was already give up.. like i said combination between BIG LUCK and OTHER PLAYERS DECISIONS was the point in winning this round. Anyway , i`m happy by the win and i think i deserve it not because my "GREAT" play this round , i deserve it for all the good rounds i did and i quess i just get repaid for all unlucky things that happen to me every other round. Thnx again for good words , i`m more than happy because i not just win the round , i win your recognition wich is important for me than the win.Thnx

</p><p><br />Firstly, I should congratulate Kenshiro on his win.  He played a very good round that took some extreme dedication at times. It was sad that he resorted to cheating accusations after my hit on Make the circle beeega  (# 18), but despite what he said, I could not hit Monte Carlo  (# 18) safely. I was at uni when he sent, getting home to see he sent 3 hours previously. If I could have hit him earlier, I couldn't after his masonries came in. A raze would potentially see him breakable, but I was reluctant to resort to that and it would have meant Monte could return the hit when his troops returned. Soon after that Make the circle beeega  (# 18) sent, leaving me the opportunity to leave turtle and send safely. It may have been lucky, but it is what it is - a clean hit.
</p><p>My husband (Frotteurism  (# 39) - the exiled one) prepared a sim of ~775 acres, ~200DM and 7.8k dp. After missing a login or two and a plat bonus that was reworked for slightly less land and DM. I didn't keep any records, but there were other nice looking humans floating  around. Senshi  (# 31) was running a similar strat, but I had more DM than he did earlier on. Conversion was made easier with #14 and #8 fireballing each other, meaning I needed to train little dp during that time. Predictably, Anders (Several Board Aliases (# 14)) began to fall away leaving Morty (Death Rides a Pheonix  (# 8)) threatening to run away. This is around the time when Kenshiro began to look really dangerous, culminating in the round changing (imo) 2 second hit. Kenshiro denied Morty their attempt to make him bounce and the opportunity to trade hits. I kept my defence good during this time, seeing that Senshi  (# 31) was only training op, hoping for an opportunity to come my way that couldn't be retalled. After Morty hit Senshi  (# 31) I was able to grab 699+ from Morty, pushing me into a nice position. Despite being able to peg Kenshiro back to bottomfeeds there was too much ground to make up. Hitting Make the circle beeega  (# 18) allowed me another chance, but I needed a ~72% hit at the end to force Kenshiro to send again. I waited for Senshi  (# 31) to suicide on Morty in the dying hours, but it never happened and invasion was disabled soon after that.
</p><p>This is still my highest finish, eclipsing my 5th place a few rounds back, when I explored. None of that would have been possible without the great advice, encouragement, ops help and fun that gammeloni (Temper Tantrum  (# 39)) provided. She is truly one of the best  packies around and deserves a top finish one of these days. I wish her all the best with what she has coming up in her life, I know it will work out great! Thanks to The Thing (Klismaphilia  (# 39)), even if he was inactive for large periods of time, I'm sorry your round went the way it did after losing the net. Lastly, thanks to my husband for building this sim, strat and for his advice and encouragement along the way. Sorry that I couldn't pull off the win in the end, but at least we got close!&nbsp;:)
</p>
<a name="Controversies" id="Controversies"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline"> Controversies </span></h1>
<p>After Kenshiro gave his speech, there was some debate over the legitimacy of his win. His history of cheating was cited, along with some accusations of foul play that round. Shortly thereafter, Sparticus claimed to have firsthand knowledge that Kenshiro cheated.
</p>
<a name="Sparticus.27s_Testimony" id="Sparticus.27s_Testimony"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Sparticus's Testimony </span></h2>
<p>I didn't want to go into too many details about this, but people have complained that I was too vague. So here goes.
Kenshiro and Merf were both communicating with one of my packies this round. I was only vaguely aware of this at the time, as he didn't mention it too much.
</p><p>Around the time that Kenshiro was starting to get big, and Merf was at his peak, my packie suggested that we declare war and sink Merf. 1 of our packies had already flaked on us, and another was out of range, so there was only 4 of us to get the job done. We ran the numbers and determined that we had enough strength to do some decent damage, but not enough to keep a significant amount of OP home.
</p><p>We decided to go for it anyway. Clear sights later revealed that a lot of extra boats got sunk. As it turns out, the whole thing was Kenshiro's idea, and he sank boats at the same time we did. He also claimed to be running the DE account, who chipped in on sinking as well.
</p><p>I already mentioned before that Kenshiro asked my packie to hit Merf, while Merf asked my packie to hit Kenshiro. Merf also admitted to farming the Icer. So you could say that Merf might have won the round if not for all these shenanigans, but it would have been a dirty win either way.
</p><p>I won't divulge the packie's name. Everyone involved knows who it is. He can come forward if he wants to.
