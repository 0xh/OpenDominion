<p>Lorem ipsum.
</p>
<a name="Roundwin_Story" id="Roundwin_Story"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline"> Roundwin Story </span></h1>
<p>I packed with Morphling, PsStT, Wart, Chris and Matt (PsStT's brother). I was 
hoping to play spud, since i thought they would be very strong with the huge 
food bonus they got. 'Too bad', i got Goblin, wave 5.
</p><p>Since i was to lazy to make a oop sim, morph made me a great one. I came oop 
with 4K defense, and something like 9.200 offense (that adds in 150*6 our 
icekin put in realmimps oop). Oop, i didnt have a premium (morph did me some 
searches though), so i had a hard time finding targets, and i did quite bad 
considering my offense, grabbed about 300 acres if i remember correctly.
</p><p>A couple hours later i got grabbed by one of the Goblins in 190. I was quite 
suprized, since i had one of the top networths and a decent defense. Usually 
thoose dominions dont get grabbed oop. I saw in my towncrier the other strong 
people got hit aswell by 190, and the other top NW gobbo got a hit aswell. 
Later i heared thoose were Rambo's multies, smacking the competition. The 190 
gobbos were the first guys to land on my 'to hit' list.
</p><p>9 hours after i didnt dare to send all (to defend again 190) and that resulted 
in 930 acres or so 21 hours oop. On thoose acres i think i got something like:<br />
450 smithies<br />
147 homes<br />
83 farms<br />
35 ore mines<br />
70 alchs {leftovers from oop}<br />
40 factories {leftovers from oop}<br />
40 lumber yards<br />
65 towers<br />
30 docks<br />
</p><p>I trained up a save defense and offense and started grabbing. Since there were 
many fast races i wasnt straight on top early. I hang around somewhere in the 
top 20. Training defense to defend top op, and increasing my offense steadily.
</p><p>around 2000 acres i had something like:<br />
450 smithies<br />
400 homes<br />
180 farms<br />
200 ore mines<br />
70 alchs {leftovers from oop}<br />
40 factories {leftovers from oop}<br />
90 lumber yards<br />
135 towers<br />
60 docks<br />
375 diamond mines<br />
</p><p>The build was aimed at a big income. I kept enough homes to fill all the jobs 
i had. As a realm, we also decided to go for realmimps, and we would all run 
10% ore mines from 2K acres and onwards. Simply build farms/towers etc etc. On 
the rest of the acres i didnt used for thoose things i build diamond mines.
</p><p>around 2K, i had a big offense, and after doing another grab and training up, 
i had savely sendable top op. This was also the point we took the Temple of 
the Damned. I was pretty scary now. While my troops were returning i spied on 
some people in the top, and i noticed some big gobbo (Malaysia... Truly asia) 
with troops out, and i could quite easily hit him. He checked me back, and saw 
i could hit him. I left to watch some soccer, since my troops werent back 
anyway, and decided to hit that gobbo in the commercial break. When i came 
back i was fairly suprized, realm 27 declared war on me. That realm contained 
a couple small HaLL halfers. Since i didnt have any guard because i hit the 
wonder a couple hours earlier, they were in my range. They demo'ed me to 0%, 
so i coudnt make a hit. I was quite sad, because i realized that by the time i 
was in rg, they could grow into that range, and by the time i was in eg, they 
could be there too, so i considered my round as over. One of my realmies 
helped me out bigtime here: Chris. He hit thoose hobbbos out of my rg rang, so 
i could starting get morale back. Thanx a lot for that chris. Right before i 
joined royal guard, they gave me a good sinking though. It was easy to figure 
Malaysia.. Truly asia was responsible for the demo/sinking session, so i added 
him to my to hit list.
</p><p>Since i ran decent docks, i had enough boats to almost full send by the time i 
had my morale back. (about 3 days after getting the TOD). Noone big was out 
now though, so i had to settle with some smaller goblin. when my troops 
returned 9 hours later, i attacked some top 10 firewalker (thanks Wart for the 
draftee killing here), and then i hit one of the 190 goblins. This would be 
one of the many retals done this round. I was top dominion when all of thoose 
acres came in. I build homes for full employment, and a load of diamond mines. 
Again started training to a big op, and now i hit the other goblin in 190 
twice.
</p><p>around 3K acres i had:<br />
920 dimaond mines<br />
730 homes<br />
450 smithies<br />
265 farms<br />
200 ore mines<br />
70 alchs {leftovers from oop}<br />
40 factories {leftovers from oop}<br />
90 lumber yards<br />
135 towers<br />
100 docks {upped them after sinking}<br />
</p><p>Three of my realmies got deleted between 2K and 3K, and Titans were bashing 
our realmimps, so we decided to stop pumping realmimps. Since improvements are 
very important, i pumped up my diamond mines bigtime between 2K and 3K.
</p><p>4000 acres:<br />
1000 homes<br />
1150 diamond mines {stopped building em at 1150}<br />
450 smithies<br />
360 farms<br />
200 ore mines<br />
70 alchs {leftovers from oop}<br />
40 factories {leftovers from oop}<br />
200 lumber yards<br />
240 towers<br />
140 docks
</p><p>between 3K and 5K not much happened, and the top kept on growing steadily.
</p><p>5000 acres:<br />
1400 homes<br />
1150 diamond mines<br /> 
450 smithies<br />
450 farms<br />
200 ore mines<br />
70 alchs {leftovers from oop}<br />
40 factories {leftovers from oop}<br />
230 lumber yards<br />
300 towers<br />
160 docks<br />
550 masonries<br />
</p><p>my imps got decent with the decent gem production, and since i stopped 
building dm, i had space available. This space got filled with Masonries.
</p><p>around 5K, rambo (Malaysia.. Truly asia) and me were somewhat ahead of the 
other people, both land and military wise. We both had the op to hit eachother 
if we would send, so we used some sort of trick: sent just seconds before the 
hourchange. This means, that if one decides to hit the other, the other can 
retal, and visa versa. This resulted in us both staying away from eachother.
</p><p>Then rambo did something interesting: he send 11 minutes AFTER a hourchange. i 
noticed that about 10 minutes later. He left about 2K more defense than i had 
offense though. I just had to nail him. after all he did this round i coudnt 
let him go, while i was this close. I checked how i could up my offense and 
lower his defense. The options were my realmimps, my forges for increasing my 
op, and kill dratees and raze rambo to lower his dp. Luckily i had a realmie 
(Wart) that saved about 1 million ore for when he would be done converting. He 
decided to help me out and invested in it in my realmimps. Also, he and me 
killed some of rambo's draftees. Still, i was slightly short, so i had to see 
if i could get him razed. Razing shoudnt happen of course, but this guy is 
such a lamer, so i didnt mind using it on him. Thing is: it's kinda hard to 
find someone willing to raze, since they gain nothing from it and you will get 
a nice grab. t00th hated rambo badly though, so he razed 210 of his smamans to 
dead. i now had enough op (by 50 points) to hit rambo. This resulted in 500 
acres for me, and my main competer loosing 500. he couldnt get me back, so he 
got t00th demo'ed to 0% , razed a couple of times and Lightning Bold badly. 
Then he grabbed him all-in twice. Sorry for that t00th, if i knew that would 
happen, i woudn't have asked. Thanks a lot for the help here.
</p><p>Because rambo was grabbing to regain acres, his op dropped, and i grabbed four 
days in a row at that point i think, so i got quite big fast.
</p><p>6000 acres:<br />
1620 homes<br />
1150 diamond mines <br />
450 smithies<br />
540 farms<br />
225 ore mines<br />
70 alchs {leftovers from oop}<br />
40 factories {leftovers from oop}<br />
240 lumber yards<br />
360 towers<br />
160 docks<br />
1145 masonries<br />
</p><p>7000 acres:<br />
1750 homes<br />
1150 diamond mines <br />
450 smithies<br />
630 farms<br />
280 ore mines<br />
70 alchs {leftovers from oop}<br />
500 factories {got lots hills and rezoning became expensive}<br />
280 lumber yards<br />
420 towers<br />
160 docks<br />
1145 masonries
</p><p>I was ahead in land and military, so when rambo started to pump up offense, i 
joined in. That was in my advantage, since i had more peasants and thus i 
could pump faster. After i while, i was close to hitting rambo all in. I 
calculated it, and i had some neat little plan about sinking him (so he coudnt 
retal) and magic snare so he coudnt cast ares' call. Something weird happened 
though: he send out. I could easily hit him for 740 acres or so. i think i was 
somewhere around 8000 acres now.
</p><p>8000 acres:<br />
2160 homes<br />
1150 diamond mines <br />
450 smithies<br />
720 farms<br />
310 ore mines<br />
70 alchs {leftovers from oop}<br />
600 factories<br />
320 lumber yards<br />
480 towers<br />
180 docks<br />
1560 masonries
</p><p><br /> 
A couple days later i hit romothecus, but then rambo did something i didnt 
think of. He had his alliance to hit the Lair of the Dragon, and then his 
realmie did the final hit. So now rambo had suddenly 10% more op, and he hit 
me for 818 acres. he lost his wonder a couple hours later though, so i hit him 
back for 650. After that romo made a calculation error, so i could hit him 
again. Rambo hit Hook i think.
</p><p>I now had only rambo in range, and rambo only me and romothecus. I was much 
bigger than rambo though, and my strat was more efficient than his. So, when 
we both started training op, i could do it much faster. I trained up enough to 
hit him all in. a day later i did that again. i was now 9.8K acres, and noone 
was left in my range. I stopped building about ~8500 build acres. If your 
interested in that build, you will see it with my final info.
</p><p>I had noone left in range, so pumped offense bigtime. Towards the end of the 
round, the 71 goblin and spirit entered my range, and after that Ronne (Gave 
Bloody InsinQ hints). I hit them all, and ended up slightly over 12K acres &nbsp;:) 
</p><p>something i dont think i mentioned anywhere: as a gobbo, you train offense 
before you train defense! Since wolfies are much more expensive, you can 
afford a lot less of them than you can buy shamans. So, you train wolfies 
first to keep your income big, then you train shamans.
</p><p>Thanks Thomas, Rockhard, PsStT, Morphling, Wart, Furdo, Matt, Olav, Chris, 
Bodfy, all other realmies, and also thank you t00th.
