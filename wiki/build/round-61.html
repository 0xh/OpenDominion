<p>What an interesting round and an excellent note to go out on.
</p><p>Huge thanks to all of my Realm, not just my direct pack - for excellent help with ops (Sonyuhshidae, Panda) and for others huge contributions elsewhere, such as baraccat MD and his insane wonder suiciding! I think he contributed close to 300k total damage to the FoY when we took it, which is a massive effort from a 2k woodie.
</p><p>As for the pack - you guys are the best. We played the round with 5 for the most part, with myself, AJ(Quintessence), monkeyboy(White Cotton), Pasi(Bloodbath) and spooks(Rogowaty), after Ed all but quit first day of protection.
</p><p>Goal was to explore and tech at a pretty fast pace, myself and monkey's plan was 16 techs ASAP (we didn't bother to calc out how long that may take) and to basically convert once that was done. Plan was to run full LB up to ~7-8k of them, by which time we would hopefully have enough forests next to the 450 schools to build mystics.
</p><p>From there, all was quiet till conversion time. Once we started converting, we figured we were in a pretty good spot with respect to the other converters, however 39 had already taken a dominant position in the round.
</p><p>By the time we had finished converting (if i recall correctly) the orc(Rio) was already out of our EG range and well ahead, so we didn't have to worry about defending him, and within a shortish period of time we started to become quite strong in relation to everyone outside the few big guys in 39.
</p><p>When the 43 WE full RR suicided fringe and 39 slowed their growth, our efficiency served us well and we made ground on the rest of the guys, other than the orc.
</p><p>When AJ made the selfless move to head into range so that we could be the only realm of attackers with regular info on him - it provided us a big platform to grow for a short time out of range of his threats, though it was hard on AJ having to have dp so much higher than other attackers at that time.
</p><p>After the week or so of growing just outside his EG range, I saw the spud in 25 who was ridiculously underdefended and hit him on like 240k when I had ~300k to send - despite him being 125% of my size. I was so excited about the prospect of the hit I did not bother to actually check that the hit would send me into orc territory, which was a terrible move on my part as it meant I went in not only when I wasn't fully ready, but I entered right at the bottom of the range, as opposed to trying to get as far in as possible. Anyhow, a few hairy moments were had as I managed to only narrowly keep my all in dp safe.
</p><p>At some point in here we got the Fountain of Youth which provided me (on like 46% homes) with about an extra 7k peasants, which was nuts at the time.
</p><p>I think I spent like a week pumping mystics at that time, I believe I went from having ~37-38k on the way into range, to having 50k+ before I was able to send again (as well as 3-4k LB's).
</p><p>Once I got to a stage where I was getting close to being able to send in range, AJ began the sacrificing of his round by going full psycho-Gnome, and forced Rio to train dp.
</p><p>We had planned a previous attempt to bring down Rio, which ended miserably due to the VM reduced casualty bonus being amazing. AJ had pumped large spies and managed to drop them so that he could dump approx 10k SS to hit the orc, after which myself and cotton had sufficient RR op and plat to follow, however we didn't anticipate 1.8% defensive casualties on a 125% hit, so the follow ups didn't happen and AJ just copped a retal instead.
</p><p>It all appeared to be a glitch on Rio's round and I was close to giving up at this point, until AJ managed to get in range and train op/GN and temples the remainder of the round, keeping the orc home.
</p><p>The plan then was for AJ to hold as long as possible and for us to try and grow, and I guess we weren't too optimistic about that, however it turned out pretty good.
</p><p>I felt sorry for Rio, as he played a very good round and was unlucky not to be able to finish it, but I think his efforts to let his realmies catch up actually did more harm than good, often sitting when easy hits were available, rather than growing faster and running higher homes/rax and less mods with spec troops.
</p><p>Once AJ pinned Rio down I was fortunate enough that the insane week of dp training I had done meant I didn't actually have to train anymore the remainder of the round - basically using 100% rezone of hits and the progressive razing of my smiths to help increase my dp and going for full blown rangers for the final 5 days or so helped me get a lot of hits in. I peaked at ~46k druids.
</p><p>I didn't keep track of round progress, who I hit, or what went on as I never expected to write one of these..

<p>Thanks to pack and thanks to aj for giving us the strat with WE (having 400+ schools before oop was kinda insane&nbsp;;D.) No sleep for most of the round is bad for me. It's a great way to quit though. I got back for 2 rounds and it seems I wont be playing anymore. I guess the only way I would ever play again is with the same pack. And since AJ will be busy i doubt that will happen.
</p><p>Thanks to pasi for being there telling me not to do my stupid things and also for discussing acers and stuff
</p><p>Thanks to chris the sage for bouncing strat ideas all round and for being awesome with a mustach
</p><p>Thanks to spooks for always being around when I needed revs. Would not have had this finish without him. Although he wasent on much for chats he managed to always be around when I needed to grab. If that was intentional I dont know but I like to think it was.
</p><p>But biggest thanks will go out to AJ the star of our realm. I like to think he was always 1 step ahead of everyone else around when it came to thinking out scenarios and planning moves . Sadly most of those plans or should I say scenarios was us getting extremly owned by either Lorelai or 39 or Xing.
</p><p>Im glad we did not face AJ cuz I doubt we would have won if he ran any other of the realms who had a chance for this. yes Im a fanboy
</p><p>Our win is pack effort completly noone was ever selfish in the pack and Im lucky to get to play with Legends as I judge them all to be well except for ed who cant even follow the SIm i made him&nbsp;;) &lt;3
</p><p>I meet many new people since my return some nicer than others haha.
</p><p>As for my round I got greedy on first hit and got smacked I thought if the dorf has 185k dp on 3900 I should be able to have 195k on 3670 I guess I was wrong.
</p><p>Many complain that the community got worse but it seems to be it's the "top players" that got worse cuz all the average joes I meet in this game are really nice guys cheering for us all through last week.
</p><p>I would also like to thank powermonger in 36 haha you dude are one hell of a suicider and yeh I did send you many angry messages specially after Lorelais last hit on you but in the end I ended up as the one with most acres from you so I guess I cant be that mad at you.
</p><p>Long rant. Be happy it wasent my dom that won hahaha

<p>three parts to round:
</p><p>1) explore/tech. zzz.
</p><p>2) convert, play with orc. this was the most enjoyable part of the round for me. i decided to enter range with more GT and defense than most people already there had, only to realize that he could break me by about 30-40k. luckily iKnow #36 was slightly smaller (and also more dangerous due to superior prestige and imps), so the orc could hit him first while keeping me in range, whereas if he hit me first, iKnow would escape unscathed. i built a few gt, but since i was expecting a hit i left the rest barren. orc hit iKnow and i built a ton of GT the next hour, so basically had to defend him successfully for 1 hour to survive, and ultimately survived by about 2-4k.
</p><p>from that point on, i basically tried to stay in range. reentering was always pretty scary because i would have 12 hours of reduced GTs and his training potential was so insane. a couple times he came within a few&nbsp;% of breaking me on reentry. inside his range, i was barely surviving all in, but outside of it i was overdefended by like 30-60k at various points and made a few hits sending massive rocks.
</p><p>eventually made a big hit on that perpetually underdefended undead in #25, which was key because the orc would now need 2 hits to get out of my range and i would have time to train a substantial offense. he again (correctly) judged iKnow to be the greater threat and hit him, and took the hit from me, which i think was the right play on his part.
</p><p>unfortunately for #39, the only person to follow his retal on me was the merf in #25 (who got crushed). fringe was a bit short of being able to finish me off, and all your base decided not to oversend (he had several opportunities to suicide me but i guess decided the orc had it won). i quickly made another attack to get back into range.
</p><p>3) trained at 4:3 with heavy temple pushes for the rest of the round. the main issue here was trying to convince the orc that i would hit him all in if i could, so i tried to stay about 20k short of his defense to keep him training VM for the rest of the round, which seemed to work.
</p><p>the main problem then was how to beat #32 and #36, who we really had no leverage over. #39 helped with this by sinking and snaring iKnow, and i spent most of the last week sending threatening messages to iKnow, Bazinga, and Daffy Duck. i'm not sure on the whole how effective these were until the last couple days, when at my strong suggestion iKnow delayed his attack until there was no time left to follow it with another, and Daffy trained to some insane 660k+ defense and kept substantial cavs home on his last hits, ensuring that he couldn't pass mr white cotton beard.
</p><p>&lt;3 orc's round, congrats! i know it's pretty miserable (i lost 3 huge leads in the early rounds), but i doubt anyone will forget how thoroughly you dominated most of this one.
&lt;3 pack
&lt;3 win, owed you one chris&nbsp;:]
</p><p>take care all.
