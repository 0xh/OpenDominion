<p>Well here is my review of round 21 (i try to not bore you too much with too many early round details and if you think it's still too long then don't read it^^):
I chose to play Spirit this round since i expected few Gobbos and alot humans and because my pack prefered to go evil. Else the race of my choice would have been Human since i think they are stronger then Spirits (also from the evil races Gobbo is better then Spirit imo but i played them 2 rounds ago and had no motivation to play them again). I also got a very cool pack together (Kenntoft, Kuki, Scrappy, Percy and Samantha).
</p><p>I planned to play a runaway Spirit with 50% smithies and high factories to grow quickly early. Then at about 3k acres i wanted to get rid of my smithies and replace them with Dmines to play a masonry/factory strategie lateround. Most of it i managed like i planned...i just did the razing of my Dmines not right when i wanted but it was better in the situation back then (i write beneath why).
</p><p>For the start of the round i got Wave 6 which was fine for me since i prefer that wave above all others. Thx to the low food consumption of Spirits i was able to run a strat without farms during the protection time. Also i was able to find a strat that run completly without specs unlike all other Spuds who came OOP with Banshees as defense.

</p><p>I was able to grab about 300 acres oop which set me into a nice position for all those suiciders that hit almost every top dom early...Out of the top 20 12hours oop 18 doms got hit, including me. I lost 128 acres to an orc with about 8k op and that guy was later deleted by Ross. 12hours oop i had less luck finding targets and was only able to make 1 hit for 58 acres but got good conversions there.
</p><p>Then till 2k acres not much happened...except it was a little funny that for some time Cupid and i exchange the No1 spot for some days with each other...due to different attack times all 6hours the other one was in the rank updates No1. Off course I chose a Ranking update where I was No1 to show you how it looked at about 2k acres&nbsp;:)

</p><p>At 2k i was starting to get a lead and breaking away from the others. But it didn't last long since at the moment that i was going ahead a Hall realm declared war on mine and started to fireball and sink my whole pack. The same realm (it was #140) moved after about a week to other top packs to screw them giving their boss (WINNY) an huge advantage. The Fballs weakened me enough that at 2.3k acres a Halfer was able to break me after a r'r to GN and full demo to 0% Morale! 
</p><p>8:30:09 PM The Diary of a Nobody (# 246) invaded Lord Ians Revenge (# 126) and captured 275 land. 
</p><p>The landloss didn't hurt muchsince i had immortal top op and being smaller would give me better conversions...but those halfers kept me demo'ed for about 2 days. so i lost 4 attack periods of conversions and about 400 acres that i could have hit in that time. also my pop was pretty down to the fballs from the hall blackop pack. The conversion and land disadvantage brought me into a bad position compared to the other spirits on top. Especially WINNY managed now to break away and was building huge op.I wasn't able to grow at any decent speed that moment so i razed all my smithies to dmines at 2.6k acres (i had full factories thenand due to the Fballs no peasants to train units anyway) which brought me to 1300 dmines which i increased to 1430 with the next few hits. This gave me the advantage for having huge imps lateround but also put me into a bad position that moment: everyone else had smithies and i had a bad income too so i fell behind in training troops (still don't know why i was able to keep up after razing my smithies). 
</p><p>This was the situation when i did the r'r:

</p><p>I think Cupid got hit by that Halfling too and that left WINNY alone on top with only the orc able to follow him. As you can see did Ross delete 2 guys out of the top 10 that time. This was for the Orc a lucky situation...the other top guys got hurt pretty much by WINNY and his alliance and Diary did a r'r strat to slow Cupid and me enough to fall behind. Suddenly the Orc was the top guy and he had good income and offense. So he was able to make pressure on the other top doms by keeping high op and forcing the others to build def. Also he had Spire of Illusions that time which was really annoying and a good advantage for him.

</p><p>The Orc managed to stay on top till this point. The top 10 had changed already pretty much. now was the time for Sweety to have some luck. Instead of building defense and trying to defend against the Orc he was just pumping offense and waited. At this landsizes we sat for some time if i remember right and nothing moved cause of the Orc. Only Postmodern Pocket Panda was growing extremely fast after stocking up around 20million plat and building huge amounts of offense and also he added gn and shrines. With 3 hits he entered the Orcs range and was then able to hit the Orc with all troops home since the GN reduced the def of the Voodoo Magi and the Orc was only pumping op without his realmies warning him about the Halfer (seriously who wouldn't notice a 300.000 NW jump when top NW is like 650k....he had 36hours to prepare against the Halfer which was the time the Halfer needed to grow into the Orcs range with 3 hits). After the Halfers hit the Orc just sent all his op on the Halfer (i'm not sure if it was a blind attack but it looked like one to me) and that left him with low enough def that Sweety was able to get the Orc by sending several k Ghosts with all the Spectres he had. This landlosses proved to be a disaster for 10k noob since it brought him into the range of another player who did a r'r to GN who was now able to hit the Orc. He lost about 1500 acres in a few hours then. Now sweety was on top with 4700 acres and the Halfer was able to hit him but decided to take out the Orc for another hit...and the Orc was 1300 acres smaller then Sweety (stupid move from the Halfer imo but I don’t know if there was any connection between the Halfer and Sweety). Now Sweety had a huge lead and survived a risky hit. In the following time Sweety was able to increase his advantage and got huge offense and now he stopped everyone from growing.
</p><p>In an attempt to slow him down i sent out with a def that i calculated to be just enough incase Sweety wanted to hit me safely since the Merf was able to break him if Sweety hit me. Also Sweety wasn't getting conversions from me and i hit for pretty good conversions which thx to my facs would be more gain then the loss by rebuilding my land. I sent out right after an hour change to make sure there was plenty of time that Sweety and the Merf would notice that i'm out. Both saw it, Sweety hit me about 4 minutes before hour change and got invaded like 1 minute before it by the Merf:

<br />12:53:47 PM Love Sweetie Pie Forever (# 175) invaded Lord Ians Revenge (# 126) and captured 464 land. 
<br />12:58:44 PM A Merf TO REMEMBER (# 197) invaded Love Sweetie Pie Forever (# 175) and captured 759 land. 
</p><p>It wasn't killing the spud off course but it slowed him down since all his land was built and he had no factories. The only thing i didn't thought was Cupid sending out after that completely underdef compared to Sweetys op and giving him his landadvantage back right away. shortly after that it looked like this:

</p><p>This was about 54 hours after Sweety was deleted so i grew almost 2k acres in 2 days with those 4 hits:
<br />12:55:58 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Lord Ians Revenge (# 126) conquered 432 land from Kan Ni Na (# 260).
<br />6:49:38 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Lord Ians Revenge (# 126) conquered 428 land from Si Pai Kia (# 260).
<br />6:59:47 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Lord Ians Revenge (# 126) conquered 476 land from est (# 24).
<br />6:59:40 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Lord Ians Revenge (# 126) conquered 494 land from Vuurspuwende Vuurtoren (# 48).
</p><p>Looking at the conversions those 4 hits where all bad but i got a good land advantage and finally my factories paid off (i seriously thought about getting rid of them during the times when 10k noob and Sweety kept me from growing since they have been wasted land during those waiting periods). The factories brought me the lead in this cause no one else was even close to build new acres as quick as i did and i got a huge population boost then. After my last buildings came in on 7.6k acres i had an income of 404.163 plat/hour with 110.9k peasants. This was my build and imps at that time:

</p><p>I started training huge amounts of Spectres then but lost temple of equality to #246 shortly after the last of those 4 hits. Zen in #246 was also building up huge offense to threaten me and together with ToE he was dangerous. Also i had a big problem with his Halfer realmie growing into my range which made the threat even worse to me with the possibilty of getting demo'ed. Almost my whole realm supported me and my pack to get the Temple back from them and after that happened i was able to send out my offense without 
Zen able to hit me. I also had a target lined up and was checking what op the Halfer in Zens realm had when i realised that his turtle def wasn't really good. I checked his spells and he was without Frenzy so i was able to hit the biggest problem i had, the Halfer with his demo ability. 
</p><p>7:19:47 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Lord Ians Revenge (# 126) conquered 549 land from Postmodern Pocket Panda (# 246). 3696 ghosts
</p><p>Also that hit gave me good conversions...only the difference in my size and my target cap'ed the conversions. 12hours later i was able to get the guy that i wanted to hit originally since he was just right inside my range (i had the luck that he explored about 70-80 acres to grow into my range right in time when my troops returned). I was sitting safely on 8.8k acres then with no one else even on 7k:

</p><p>At 8.4k acres i got Conquerers Will and i tell you that tech is awesome. Zen managed to grow back into my range pretty soon and made the mistake of declaring peace on another 
realm. My op was good enough to hit him with all troops home and Ares Call running...Only i had to wait some hours since by now the Merf had a very dangerous offense and i couldn't hit zen without the merf hitting me. But i had around 40k more peasants and was able to outtrain both of them. When i checked Zen 1 hour before my hit he released about 5k spies and wizzies to draftees to let me bounce and pumped his ressources into walls. I saw the NW drop and took his infos again so his try was useless, but the moment i sent i was only on 4k more def then max op of the Merf (470k op from Merf vs my 474k dp). I was bit worried that he might deal enough dmg to my castle with 3-4 Lightning Bolts to be able to hit me (and he had pretty much Mana that moment). But luckily he didn't try and i had like 4k def incoming every hour after the hit so i was quickly safe again.
</p><p>After that hit the Merf was the only one in my range and i could have suicided him...but with peace on me i wasn't sure if he will really lose enough land to fall outside my range cause if he stayed in my round would have been over. I decided to play it the safe way and just wait since i was on 9.5k acres and the Merf as 2nd biggest on 7.7k. Short time later also cupid and The smurfs entered my range but none of those had even close enough defense to defend my offense if they sent out their troops to make hits.
</p><p>Nothing moved then till 25hours before the round was over..and then i caught a Titan in my news:
</p><p>1/26/2004 11:13:40 PM Spies from Prometheus, Titan of Fire (# 2) were discovered within the barracks! We executed 32 spies.  
<br />1/26/2004 11:13:43 PM Spies from Prometheus, Titan of Fire (# 2) were discovered within the barracks! We executed 32 spies 
</p><p>Till this point i never paid attention to them since they gave me no conversions...with only 1 exception of checking the op of the top Titan when he was in my range earlier but since he was far away from any dangerous op i decided to keep on ignoring them.
Hard to tell how surprised i was to see him in my news since he was suddenly almost 2k bigger then the last time i looked into realm #2. I checked his op then if he was any dangerous and saw that i was easily able to hit him out of my range again. I just spend some more ops on the other 3 in my range to make sure no one had close enough op to hit me (i failed like 8 bs tries on The smurfs and didn't know how much exactly he would have till my troops are back but it was impossible with his peasants to train that much op at once as he needed to get me). I think i sent something around 585k op against his 565k turtle defense...Didn't even check if he had ares running or not and oversent cause i didn't want to think about tricks like releasing wizzies/spies or pumping imps to bounce me or if i made a calculation error.
</p><p>11:59:51 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Lord Ians Revenge (# 126) conquered 603 land from Prometheus, Titan of Fire (# 2).
</p><p>Those unexpected 600 acres brought me to 10k acres and i was happy to reach that.
my troops returned 13hours before the round was over and both The smurfs and Cupid where outside my range then for some hours till they got their land in (both sent out shortly after my hit on Prometheus). The Merf was sending then at 11.59am to make his last hit so i was able to hit him the hour after and still get the acres in for the rankings. Also i explored 52 acres after i hit the Merf (hell expensive EG exploring on 10k acres...atleast conquerers took 
15% of that price so i paid 'only' 75k/acre^^).

Construction advisor and castle are from the hour before the last acres came in (when i still was 10123 acres)
</p><p>Only 2 things left that i wanna make clear:
</p><p>1st: Many blamed me to have NAPs this round and i only won cause i'm NAP'ed with this guy or that: 
I had no NAPs except for 2 friends (and only with them and not their realms) and none of them played any role in the overall rankings.
</p><p>2nd: I wanna finish by declaring what was up with the inrealm orefarms for my realm improvements:
I talked one of our small guys into pushing our realm imps and he built pretty much oremines i 
think but i don't know how much exactly he was running all the time. But it probably was about 50%. The 2nd in my realm who built huge oremines was one of my realmies. When he was about 3k acres (he was no1 lyc that time and his pos in the overall ranks wasn't bad too) he decided that he wasn't able to reach his aim of top 10 overall anymore. He said if he can't reach it he wants the rest of the pack to be able winning the round and their race rankings. I wanted him to win his race ranks but he was not interested in it and followed his plan to support us. And those realmimps are for all in the realm so stop calling him my personal orefarm since he did it for the whole realm. 
</p><p>Flops of r21:
</p><p>- A billion suiciders killing everyone but alliance doms oop
<br />- Hall blackoping my realm and some others aswell
<br />- Realm improvements
<br />- Dragons/Titans for being nothing but landfarms with reduced op losses for the attacker and lateround being only realmimp killers
<br />- Many ppl blaming me for things i had nothing to do with
<br />- My pack not finishing on rank 2-6 overall&nbsp;;)
<br />- Platstealing which forces you to get up during the night so not all is stolen
</p><p><br />
Tops:
</p><p>- Having the coolest pack i ever played with
<br />- Ross showing that he deals with all cheaters he can find
<br />- Hall quitting dominion if it is true
<br />- 660k op as spud (not counting wonder into it)
<br />- Converting total of 37344 ghosts worth 33.6million plat
<br />- Best conversion was 4260 ghosts from the hit on zen
<br />- Having small guys in the realm that lack of skill (but listened to advice) but not of team spirit and helped my pack and me with wonders
<br />- Winning the 2nd round
<br />- Temple of Equality and Conquerers Will are awesome...when you are the one to have them&nbsp;:)
