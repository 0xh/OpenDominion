</p><p>So, as an explorer there isn't much of a story to my round. So I'll just be stating the main points that helped me get there.
</p><p>First of all, congrats to IC, Tjock, Anders and Nedo. You all played rounds deservant of the win.
</p><p>My round win started 4 months ago, when myself and my housemate MeggaMortY thought of running an all specs explorer with max mods. The stategy was to work on the principle that huge landsize relative to days into the round (or required DP), would allow for the very large military required, while keeping an even larger number of peasants.
</p><p>We ran some numbers for each of the races with potential - Gobbo, Kobbo and Lyc produced the best results obviously, and Kobbo was the best out of the three, as the whole strat was about pop bonus. Their growth rate was also attractive as there was a great fear of being FB'd. So, Kobbo was decided as the race for my round win. I ran numbers that suggested, due to the strat we were playing, that I would be able to run a LOT of alch's while maintaining max employment. I considered masonries, but some calculations and general knowledge showed that they weren't as good as alchs. NOTE that in the end we went for masons because Quendi also ran some numbers and he found mason would be better than alchs, and he had only 600DM’s – we had 800. And Quendi would know… We also decided to get 3 techs, to -10% exploring. 
</p><p>As we decided to do this during round 45, and I was going to be busy working for 46 and 47, round 48 was going to be the first chance to do it. And I guess it was the best round type, as there is no bump of exploring cost. As MeggaMortY was playing round 47, I got him to record top op's and top land every day.
</p><p>When I finished my mining engineering work, I returned home and commenced a full round Excel simulation (that's right, around 1250 days of simming - in a 28MB Excel file). I simmed optimally for the first 5 or so days, and then changed to exploring and constructing every 12 hours. I thought this would produce a worse result than what I would actually be doing during the round, as draftees were allowed to build up in the sim. However I didn't account for not being about to store plat for longer than really 1 hour. For DP, I used the top op's for every day of round 47 as a guildeline, and trained underlings to match it. This was the major error of the sim, as I didn't really think about having to defend 4:3's, although I always thought in the back of my head that I'll probably need to. I just didnt think about how much difference it would make.
</p><p>So, I simmed to day 31 and then stopped, because the results already showed I was going to own the round. In the simulation on day 31, I had 6850 land and 450k income. I believe the only reason this didn't materialise is that the simulation defence was around 25% less than what I ran during the round, and that accounted for a lot less income and exploring early on in the round, which worked exponentially as the round progressed.
</p><p>The strategising, calculations and simulations before the round started was where the round was really won, we just had to put them into practise.
</p><p>I followed my sim perfectly for the first 5 days, didn't miss an hour. At this point we noticed a 3rd big kobold in our realm, who looked very similar to us. I messaged him and asked what his strategy was, and it looks like it's similar to mine. He replied: "I'll be surprised if anyone is doing something similar to me." A week later when we were still looking the same, he told me his strat and it turns out (as assumed) that it was exactly the same, and that it was Quendi. Yep, there's some coincidence for you.
</p><p>So the 3 of us continued to get ahead. Quendi, with his superior exploring skills, was managing to stay slightly ahead of us and our exploring tech. However at whatever point in the round it was, I started to overtake him. I think it was coincidental that he decided to delete at this time, because he was bored. Well played Quendi.
</p><p>We defended top 4:3's from like day 5 onwards. I really dont know if that's what explorers normally do, but it seemed very necessary this round, as there were so many suicides, and we were ahead by a LOT. I'm quite sure that if someone could hit us, they would have. So Top OP may have been low, but 125% of Top OP was high.. Particularly because it was Kobolds with the big OP, and therefore huge 4:3 power. If we hadn't run so much DP we would have finished 10k+, I have no doubt. So it was a GOOD strat thankyou very much.
</p><p>We also ran around 1 wpa throught the round, for fear of bein FB'd. That didn't happen (kinda unfortunately).
</p><p>AT some point in the round I was WAY ahead of everyone (over 20% ahead of anyone), and they were all held down by Turb. #5 were down to 30k peasants and less - they were really hurting and I was sure that I had won the round comfortably. But then, Turb decided to farm out to them, giving 2 of them 1200 acres in a couple days. So they were thrown right back into the race, with my land gap reduced severely, and their peasants pumped up to 70k+ from 30k. I don't know if he actually believes he didn't make much difference farming out, but he sort of really did.
</p><p>Around day 40 I was sitting on 480k income or so, so decided to stop building and train some elites before getting back into lings for the home straight, allowing peasants to drop.
</p><p>When Anders (I Brontosaurus) blew ahead and held huge Top OP and even huger 4:3, we were just waiting for some realm to war and black-OP him, as he was holding EVERYBODY down. 20 was most likely to do so, so we were CVing often, hoping to see it. When they did go for it, we joined in, which may have been a big mistake. We kinda sunk anders, but that's about all our 1.4 spa could manage, for some stupid reason. And then, as we were really only watching the Kob's 4:3, I missed Tjocks immense OP, until I caught him CS me. I then calced him in the next 5 minutes, and then Visioned to see Military Genius, and realised he could break me by a few K. I then hit refresh to see himself and Nedo assassinating hard (but failing a lot). I panicked and released all my 2k wizards and 3k spies asap, then refreshed again to see him bounce.

</p><p>This hurt a fair bit, and I was worried Nedo would suicide out of anger, and end my round. So I carefully trained lings and stored draftees for the next 12-18 hours. I also released all my AM's and 1.5k more spies. I think I was never under his 4:3, but I did have a lot of draftees ready to be assassinated. After that I trained crazy DP, and was a good 50-80k ahead of all of 5's 4:3 OP until day 47 or so.
</p><p>Amusingly, soon after releasing ALL my wizards and AM's, Anders attempted one FB on me and failed. I liked that. None of his wizards died in the fail.
</p><p>/28/2008 4:52:55 PM Our wizards have repelled a Fireball spell attempt by I Brontosaurus (# 5)!
</p><p>We then ended the war and returned our Peace to 5, and they Warred us back 5 hours or so later. I immediately thought that was fine, as Nedo and Anders were nearly sunk already, and we could at least stop them from sending 4:3. Then I got a message from Nedo:
</p>
<dl><dd>Arrived at: 5/1/2008 5:06:57 AM
</dd><dd>
</dd><dd>Hope I remember correctly now that you cant op us as long as you're locked in peace otherwise that was a bad call...&nbsp;:)
</dd><dd>
</dd><dd>-Queen Rosa the Just of Need more COWBELLT! (# 5)
</dd></dl>
<p>I checked on IRC to find that this was true, and that sucked. We suddenly didn't have the DP buffer we wanted. Nedo then continued to pump huge suicide OP, which did the trick and cost me many acres - my calculated 9k+ finish.
</p><p>I went to the casino for the last 4 hours before invasion was disabled, knowing full well Nedo could hit me after some 'decent' assassinating. I was ready to accept that when I got home, but it didn't happen.
</p><p>So I won..
</p><p>Some more thanks go to 20 for eventually fbing Anders (but then farming out to them - unluckily). Also thanks to my realm who were willing to get the Great Market various times (after many gee-up posts by myself and Morty - they were really quite easy to 'manipulate' (but that's not the right word)). I didn't plan/expect to have it for any, let alone all, of the round.
</p><p>Slinzer (slz) was also a champion throughout the round.
</p><p>Some more notes:
</p><p>I could have finshed maybe 30 acres larger (with my stored resources) had I not been worried about my morale dropping. Nedo was still pumping at the end, and I was sure he was still willing to hit me. Lots of randoms assassinating me didn't help either, ED AND AISHA!
</p><p>Also:

</p><p>Finally: From day 5 onwards, I FG'd for a maximum of 5 nights of full sleep. The rest of the 40 days I was up every 2 hours of the night (which is kind of a strain on a relationship). And I was also active every single hour of every day. This was to stay as close to defending 4:3 as possible, and make sure I caught ANY pumps. Also because my income was massive and people were even stealing from me with all their strength after just one hour's income. So please don't tell me I was a lazy explorer...
</p><p>In conclusion, this was going to be my last round of Dominion no matter what happened, but I'm glad I went out on a win. And well done to MeggaMortY, who only fell behind as he wasn't as active as me (nobody was!).
</p><p>I probably missed a lot, but whatever. Thanks and all the best.

</p><p>First off, I want to thank my packies (even those of them who didnt stick around till the end) and realmies who did a great job in keeping the ToD for us (me) and helped me a lot with ops and draftee killings when needed - to them I owe my first finish over 7k and in the top 10 (top 5 (top 3)). I'd also like to congratulate Maverick for the great job he did (despite what all the haters say. yes, ed, I mean you&nbsp;:P) in being the first legit explorer to win a round, and in beating Denis and kari's record acres, as well as #5 who went thru a lot of sh*t and could have won the round if they hadnt been so noobish at points but took it like men, and especially Nedo, who could have razed me several times and handed tjocko the win but he chose not to. GG guys!
</p><p>Okay, here's the round story as I'm pretty sure mav won't have anything exciting to share and tjocko is a lazy ass swede and won't write one. I will accept "tl; dr" answers&nbsp;:P
</p><p>I packed the usual suspects Ed (Mkay, lizrad), Slat3r (They Killed Kenny, lizard), Elan (You bastards, lyc), and Pasi (Eating pudding, lyc). koshera couldn't pack this time around so our instant choice was Switch (screw you guys, icer) who both Elan and I, and Pasi had packed before and wanted to pack again. as you can clearly see unless you've lived on another planet for the past 11 seasons or so, we chose a South Park theme&nbsp;:) Pasi and slater wanted to be serious this time around and go fast and kill or die. that made elan and ed pick fast races (lyc and liz) and our pack was now looking as we'd sh*t people in the beginning. I, however, knew that a runaway wasn't going to be possible with everybody and his mom choosing kobold and goblin due to the tr00l nerf so I decided to rely on a slower start and potent midgame, having in mind a 6k finish.
</p><p>I'd already tried an efficient kobold in rd 45, and although the ruleset was different, decided to give it a try since last time around it was real fun. With ross deciding to implement higher research point gains on successful attacks, and my atteching going so smoothly the round before, I decided to give it another go, this time opting not for 7 but for 4 techs. jason was really hesitant as to what race to pick but since he had to go to his parents' for a week during spring break, he decided he wouldnt go fast and chose atteching icekin, inspired by Rio's rd 45 success with it - a decision he regretted ever since day 3 of the round. maybe if he'd gone ork as the initial pack plan was, things woulda turned differently for our pack but oh well.
</p><p>we landed as the only pack in realm 9 but soon enough a friend of pasi's (Capo) realm-hopped in (r00s, you gotta do something about hopping) to make us a seven-pack with an icer opsbitz. at first I thought that was actually pasi's multy as we know what a cheating scum bastard pasi in fact is behind the mask of a super sexy fin, but then it turned out it's a real person, and a rather helpful one, even though he wasn't too active.
</p><p>except the pack, there was several other active guys - Asriel (DE who helped a lot with revs on sylvans (poor bobbo) and draftee killing), ommit (a returning vet who made an awesome last week as undead after a whole round of hitting and being hit every 12 hours. I think he actually won race rankings there), Tufelhunden and Froix de Maru and several more who all pitched in on wonder grabbing and made council lively even when half the pack was gone.
</p><p>my round started very well, Id simmed a 7.5k OP on 540 acres 2nd wave (prestige and RP in mind) but something went wrong with daylight saving - Europe was like one hour more behind sever time or something like that and I ended up training grunts one hour more which gave me - amazingly - 9k OP with 2.5k def (and incoming def each hour). I utilized this to a great extent and hit for more than 310 acres (and thats given one of my targets got hit for 100 acres while I was hitting the invade button) over 3 waves, which made me top attacker by a large margin. sorry snappy for hitting you there, wouldnt have if I knew it was you&nbsp;:)
</p><p>the rest of the pack however were all later waves and bigger acres and had huge problems finding targets. I ended up on a par with ed, pasi and slater despite their initial 100+ acres lead, and elan and switch were another 50 acres or so behind. pasi was looking very good, with more than 9k op, possibly able to smack big, build temples and try to run. his turtlelessness f*cked him up though - he forgot to r/r his factories for GT 12 hours out and got duly smacked down three times which did bad for his motivation and soon enough he was done with, his latter participation in the round limited to smacking wonder twice and lurking around to feed people acres before deleting week 7.
</p><p>I got hit once here by #44 - their first time messing with us, just after I passed 1k, as usually, trying to do it with 15k def just didnt do the job so i had to stop and train another 10k before moving up again. from there we started growing, I with the inertion from my great OOP, Ed and slater on the wings of GT and temples. around us people were going nuts on specs and mods, as is habitual for all the rounds in the 40s, and Elan was slowly but surely gaining on us, hitting every 12 hours with his cheap ratmen covering him. at some point we were 4 people in the top 20, with 3 in the top 5 NW. at this point my 10% schools started slowing me down and soon, after a drunken bounce on a kobo explorer with howling instead of ares, I lagged some 2 hits behind elan and slater. I didn't lose confidence though, knowing the techs will help me maintain excellent peasents mid round. switch was really lagging behind though, and not gaining techs fast enough to make up for it.
</p><p>once the wonders started falling down, we took ToD, luckily none of us top guys had to send on it. somewhere at this point Ed grew impatient and started complaining of his race (lizard) and of having to run mod buildings so early and how hitting in 75% was so boring and how he wished he was a gnome. he would stop for longer periods than us in order to train big OP and hit bigger targets which slowed him down some but he was still in pretty good shape with elan and I finding some pretty solid targets for him and actually menacing at times. Slater was clinched into a fight for the top with 44, 39 and 17 - early kobo converters and a couple lycs, and all was well, we were expecting #31 to start converting any moment which they never did.
</p><p>once I was done teching, I r/red and had some 150-200 DMs. I started gaining on Slater and elan and somewhere there it turned out that the kobolds in #5 (Nedo and Andy, as it turned out later) had similar strats to mine, only they'd chosen 3 techs over 4 and 20% GTs instead of my 10%. these strat differences resulted in their always having more troops than me - they had started growing faster earlier and at later points in round I'd see myself on par with them land-wise but almost always lagging a few k overlords and grunts behind, hence why they were significant and I was inconsequential.
</p><p>We were headed to the 3k land mark where the event that imo shaped the round as "one of the most interesting" and "resembling the olden days", as it was later described by excited people, happened. I'd just made a semi-good hit that was gonna see me with 2.5k acres on day 17 or 18, my goal being 3k by day 21 and I was quite happy with the way the round was turning, what with slater and elan close to top and ed protecting us from behind. I need to mention something peculiar here that will probably startle most people: I calculated top OP VERY rarely, if at all, before week 5. slater was way more active and he did that when he was going to send but if he was staying home and didnt bother check people, I just trained def to 130% my OP or alternatively asked him how much OP he had as he was among the top OP people, and sent.
</p><p>so now, not having checked anybody, I sent out, in a hurry to catch HC. then I checked #44's recent ops and saw that their lizard Seaman Steaman had stocked a pile of money and 5k draftees. I checked him out and sure enough same hour he trained 4k reptiles and 1k serpents - just enough to hit me safely one hour before my troops came home. I told slater that and he did some calcs and decided that he can safely send, training several hundred spek def which, coupled with draftees, put him 2k defense in the clear. sure enough, 10 hours later #44 made their move but surpisingly it wasn't against me - I was totally insignificant and no threat to anybody as you can imagine - but against him. one of their kobold totally ruined his round and suicide - razed him, and the lizard nailed him big.
</p><p>those two hits were enough to lower his defence significantly and #10's dorf (ERIK) doubled, followed closely by #10 FW (Ivetza). this put slater out of the game, him being smaller than me now. but what was worse, it totally demotivated the rest of the pack. elan's economy was really suffering from all the ratmen and he was ready to train super OP to protect slater and me, and as already mentioned, ed was generally unhappy with his strategy and was sticking around just to scare people away from us, while switch was trailing way behind, still not having finished his techs. now that our main horse was gone, they were all left with nothing to play for. both ed and elan said they wanted to suicide someone big, if possible #44's lyc who was getting bigger and bigger despite his rather lousy economy but why not #10 who feasted on slater, even though we'd warned ivetza, who I am admittedly friends with (as in, we drink a beer now and then) that if he hit in our realm that wouldnt do good for him.
</p><p>so now the targets were set for them. #44 lizard wasn't one of them since that spek pump totally ruined him and he had to BF the whole next week. I personally still had a good position and wanted to hold it but with my pack not wanting to play anymore I got quite lazy too and my mind was also set on vengeance against Ivetza and ERIK (whom I helped a lot in his first rounds and am generally good mates with), as well as #44 who had, except the dead kobold and lizard, a lyc, a goblin (Shard, played by mickles) and another kobo (Rockhard).
</p><p>for a while we just grew along, people got FBalled heavily, #39 got farmed badly by #17 (who had 4 early converters and 2 blatant OOP farmers), we were ready to take it, as were #5 (we saw them train spies and wiz) but nothing ever came our way. so, people battling it away, #5 kobolds, #17 kobo (Seen, played by emesel) and #44 lyc shaped up as the top contesters, with #10 FW trailing a bit behind with quite some OP. I was big too, but nowhere quite as scary. at one point #5 looked like they were going to run away and thats when one of #17's guys messaged us with pleas to stop #5 together, followed shortly by the same messages from #29.
</p><p>ed got really mad for this and decided to use his humonguous cham OP on emesel. that angered a lot of people who branded it a suicide even though he never got hit back for it, others who knew #5 was the swedes (which we didnt by the way) called it an alliance play and a move to stop #5's only competition. this was of course ridiculois, first off because Ed never had anything to do with nedo et al. and never was one to ally with anybody, and second because he was the one to make the only hit on #5 by that time, having hit Nedo OOP.
</p><p>anyway, great havoc ensued and with people angered that us and #5 were the only ones to never suffer from laming and blackops, and emesel bittered for the "suicide", #17 (except the troll, random-scrub) decided to end their rounds flat out fully suiciding on tjockis (gobo, who had gotten quite strong already even though he didnt have techs) and nedo. a lot of people grabbed a lot from that, most of all #5 themselves. I stayed aside and made two other grabs which went unnoticed even though I had virtually no defence - grabs which for the first time put me in the top 10. I think here a lot of people didnt know I actually had decent OP because I had the 5% op tech and were baffled as to how I managed to get big - truth is I just timed it well.
</p><p>here Ed made another big bang, hitting #10 FW, who was one of the three people to hit tjockis (whom we thought was now dead, but oh boy did he prove us wrong!!!) which just asserted the suggestions that he was allied with the other swedes. Ivetza #10 was the only one to hit him back despite my spending two hours begging him not to. out of the whole deal the people who gained the most were #6 FW (Turby) and #44 lyc, whose dead economy was resurrected for a while and even though he never managed to be a threat again, he did finish 7k, managing to escape Ed's attempts to screw him.
</p><p>in the following week I sneaked a hit on a #14 explorer who was stealing me and elan, who was keeping up despite 2 days inactivity and genral abandonment of the game, blind (I had long hours of inactivity throughout the whole round), covering NW drop. his build was weird though, he had shrines and not anywhere near the full&nbsp;% of forests or mountain (forgot his race) he needed so I got accused by #10's ROs that I farmed him out. what was the fun part is that on this very same hit Ivetza apparently had the OP to hit me even though my NW was bigger than his but he hit Shard #44 instead and that made #44 accuse me in NAPping with the same #10 that was accusing me in farming. according to rocky and mickles (both in #44), mickles had 6k defence more than me. in a later convo with Ivetza, it turned out he didnt even know I was out due to me covering NW drop, even though I had his sylvan in my baracks. when rocky and mickles messaged me to tell me I was a cheater, I calced everything and, along with the fact they didnt count my 5% op tech, they had neglected to calc that by the time Ivetza could actually nail me (he had to wait for his phoenix to cover him from #5's OP) I'd gotten 10k raw defence in.
</p><p>the next hit Ivetza did was to hit Elan all in. that totally pissed elan off, and seeing he couldnt retal even on 4:3, he just sent out all his WWs on Ivetza, which resulted in him getting scripted. what REALLY sucked about this was the fact that #5 had declared WAR on us for our Temple OD and we needed all possible OP around to get it back ASAP. but Elan said he didnt want to feed his acres to #5 too, who, with the war active, could also get him, and his round was totally dead - he had trained defence for one week straight and still got all-inned, for which reason he decided to script out.
</p><p>naturally, Ed followed suit and 4:3ed Ivetza, which got him completely farmed off, then Ivetza hit Slater too and thats where i decided to end any relations with him and we didnt talk at all for a good two weeks or so. in the aftermath of that blood bath, the winner was turby (#6) who managed to gain a lot of acres with no OP and no pack support. I was looking good on 60k peasents, some 7-8k more than #5, similar acres but slightly crappier military build, but for all that I was extremely unhappy that I'd lost my whole pack (except switch, who was ever the unhappier with what turned out to be a really unfruitful and boring strategy) and didn't give a toss about what was going to happen.
</p><p>I decided to go vengeful and hit Tetre (Athens, #44). then I made a hit on one of #8's merfolk and people messaged me to say #5 had the op to hit me and thanks for handing them the win, f*cker. but surprisingly #5 didnt hit me, and in a later convo he said he never checked me as he didnt know I was out due to my covering NW drop again.
</p><p>in the meanwhile Shard #44 (mickles) was climbing up and when he sent out extremely underdefended but pretty sure no-one would hit him because Andy in #5 had HUGG op incoming, I nailed his ass. he got very pissed and promised to make my life miserable and said our plans on packing next round were off now that he's seen what a douchebag I am (he actually never delivered on the making me miserable, except for killing my draftees and stealing from me once or twice, but chose to finish decently and made an amazing run into the top 10 despite having been hit thrice.)
</p><p>In fact Andy couldnt hit me even though he had war vs me but he changed plans and took ToD earlier (they wanted to wait the full 3 days of the war before taking it) and with the additional 10% OP he managed to bag me in. however, I still got 200 acres out of it so no real harm was done except that Andy now stood as the sole contester for the top, along with #31's kobo explorers maverick and morty who at points had 600-700 acre lead. with elan gone and pasi inactive, we didnt succeed into taking back the wonder on time so I had to also declare war on them, at which point they declared on #17 to re-take OOP which they'd lost twice to some lingering multies there.
</p><p>so, in the wake of week 5 close to or over 5k were Nedo and anders in #5, turby in #6, ivetza in #10 (whose immortal phoenix and close-to-immortal salamanders let him basically unscathed from Ed's shenannigans) and I, as well as some explorers - #16 merfolk, #37 and #41 icers and #44 lyc. morty and maverick were maintaing a solid lead way ahead, the Great Market proving once again to be kobos greatest friend. at this point turby and ivetza started making OP, and #5 had scary numbers too. I, being all alone, decided to train def instead and try to sneak hits while they were trying to outpump each other.
</p><p>I saw #20's HUGE sylvan (bobbo) lose networth for a good half day (15 hours of starvation as later macros told me) but nobody was touching him so I trained enough op to hit him. just as I was about to do that, turby dumbed out and hit #16's merfolk 20k leagues under see, which left him wide open for Nedo's incoming grunts. apparently turby had some agreement with anders that said anders wouldnt hit him unless completely safe but nedo wasn't in on it and acted accordingly. then anders followed safely. turby got pissed (cursing them badly on IRC lol), trained speks to retal but they saw it on time, released wizards and also trained specs to defend themselves so he ended up razing anders and destroying all the GTs he could, perhaps thinking it'd get him enough time to be scripted.
</p><p>well it didnt, and both nedo and anders just followed on him. when my troops returned from hitting the starving sylvan, I cashed in on him too, leaving very safe def, and those b2b hits gave me 1.1k acres in 24 hrs time which I used to build 6-7% GTs and a ton of homes, giving me close to 85k peasents on 6.3k acres (only maverick and morty had more at the time) and 270k income on day 40 of the round.

</p><p>In all this mess Ivetza didn't do anything but pump OP on his 23k peons and 11% temples, and #31 explorers were the biggest winners because they could grow freely. Now I had a small lead over Nedo and anders had a small lead on me. when Ivetza finally sent his dumb high OP, he left just a tad under tjockis (Rolfosaurus #5) OP and got punished for it by getting hit. then, just seconds before ivetza was home, anders bounced on him like the bouncing nublet he is (previous round's domname&nbsp;:P) which turned to be a very important failure - it apparently set ivetza's mind on killing tjockis off and not letting #5 win the round, which he succeeded in by training humonguous OP and building ever more temples with which he threatened to suicide them - only because andy didn't get him out of range.
</p><p>In the stalemate that followed, macros (#20 halfer) et al. decided to juice things up and screw #5 completely - they declared war and sunk andy (who made the mistake of dropping guard) to oblivion, all the while FBballing him. #31 chipped in on the sinkage action too, which gave them some black points for allying with #20 against their only threat. in the meanwhile I was training def like crazy to defend Ivetza and at one point managed to hit #39's kobold all in ares off.
</p><p>while #20 and #31 were busy killing anders, they neglected to see that tjockis had immense OP. maverick however managed to bounce him by releasing spies and wiz right after they assasinated his draftees. nevertheless, tjockis b2b war hit #20 human, gaining 1700 acres which was definitely going to hand him the win, had it not been for Ivetza's suicide for 650+ acres. Nedo hit Ivetza back in less than 12 seconds (didnt beat the record but pretty impressive, I was there like 3 mins later&nbsp;:() to come out on top which was his last attack in the round because for his great disappointment Ivetza was still in range and his 400k OP and 15% temples were ready to suicide again.
</p><p>I was still training def - something a lot of people, friends and foes alike, critisized me for, as it meant I'd left the round in other people's hands and deprived myself of a chance for the win so I guess I owe them an explanation. Frankly, with my overally cowardly style of play displayed this round (and, in fact, many other rounds) I don't think I deserved the win. I think Maverick deserved it a lot better - being so very active and cautious for everybodys 4:3 all the while, and tjockis even more - having come back after all the sh*t he ate. on top of that, deprived of my pack I really wasnt motivated enough to care about it and manage to seize the opportunities that presented themselves. I prefered to finish decently in what may be my last serious round instead of spending 45 days fighting for top and then get killed, as happened in rd 45.
</p><p>so anyway, I trained like 60k def more than #5 had and sent moderately safely twice more, on both occasions leaving open for nedo the chance to suicide me and hand tjockis the win on a plate - something he didn't do, in his words, because it's not in him to ruin someone who played a clean and nice round, an attitude I think we very much lack in the Dom community nowadays for which i have to give him props. I made my first finish over 7k, my first finish over 8k even and reached the top 3.
</p><p>however, a sense of bitterness has stayed with me out of the whole deal despite the truly great finish. I wish my friends and packmates had been with me all through the round. I don't think I'll have another round on top soon but at least I'll finally have something to show for my 6 years of playing&nbsp;:)
</p><p>Thank you all for an enjoyable time and good luck next round!
</p><p>also, get a f*cking life you f*cking nerd, you just spent fifteen minutes reading the account of another nerd about 7 weeks of playing a godd*mn stupid text-based online game. get a job or something. find a girl. or a boy, FGO and devasas.

<p>Wanted to try full round attack with them kobbos but got hit by Ed 12h oop and had to go for some schools/dm instead. Managed to take off slightly ahead of Anders (bronto) who converted at 1200 but way behind Emesels conversion. At this time there was some multi-sui-laming going on from #39 that I sort of missed completely being busy trying to catch up after the Ed incident. Mac &amp; co also took turns FBing the fast lycs during this time. 
</p><p>Then the shit hit the fan for us. We were just starting to enjoy the kick from our slower strat when Ed did a big hit on Emesel when he was starting to look really strong. I wont call it a suicide since he got away with it without being grabbed at all. In any way Emesel &amp; co decided to take it out on us since we were coming out on top. If I got the story straight, Rommel suicided Tjockis with his own and emesels accounts and a few hours Rommel again suicide-razed me with Jirikys account (this time against Jirikys will) and then someone else suicided me successfully. I still consider this a lame thing to do, especially the account-hijacking part and I am disappointed that Ross did nothing about that part even though Rommel was bragging about it on the boards. Emesel was still looking pretty hot, even after he was grabbed he was well before IC and about in the same position as me before the suis. Sorry I was whining about this on the boards but I though why the heck not, I have no problem being the annoying one and there could have been an advantage for our pack to be had there if Ross had not been determined not to bother. That allowed Rommel to keep playing long enough to singlehandedly raze our wonder too before deleting. In the meantime there was also a sylvan FB-multi that fireballed Tjockis but he was eventually deleted, but after the damage was already done even though we reported him like 4 days before the FBing started.
</p><p>Anyways, we stuck in there and recovered decently. Instead of having pulled away we now faced Ivetza (#10 FW), Turby (#6 FW) and IC (#9 kobbo) who all gained lots of free land from the suicides. At this point I was playing rear guard since my round was more ruined than Tjockis' and Andy's so I choked myself and built op to keep Turby in and then he send to I grabbed him. Turby dumped spec to hit me or Andy so even though Andy had intended to hit the merf for more land originally he had to hit Turby as well to get him downsized (we expected him to stick around and give us hell). Instead he sent all and bounced on Andy and we could grab him back. That gave us undeserved 1000+ acres and sent us back in the game.
</p><p>Next big thing I remember is the Ivetza story. Tjockis grabbed him and Andy should have grabbed him too and sent him out of range for good but he forgot to cast Howling and bounced. After than he just built temples and op. In the meantime Tjockis gained speed and could have made the homerun by hitting Mav but Tjockis missed the release and bounced. (a little sloppyness there cost the round, he did a fresh CS to see that he didnt invest anything but failed to see the drafts...) A while later when Tjockis made the double war-tap on Bell, the #10 FW suid Tjockis and I grabbed him back. Another good example why temples should be included in 4:3. Ives dominion was completely dead and only temples allowed him to affect the game for the ones remaining in the race. I guess we could have played it safer here and tjockis would have won again but at this stage we were really bored with the way the round had turned out, tjockis said who cares about 2nd or 10th place and went for it. 
</p><p>Only the finish left now. I decided to just pump my op and hope that it would slow down the rest enough for Tjockis to still be able to outgrow the rest but he didnt have enough momentum for that left in him. I had the option to sui Mav at 11-12 am and give the win to Tjockis but fortunately Ross ended the round before that. Whatever I had done there would have been considered stupid/lame by half the players so it was best this way.
</p><p>To Mav: Well played, very actively and awarely. You deserved your win for sure as things turned out. Dont nerf exploring, we need acres in the game. Even under these circumstances it took a release-bounce plus a timely end-time of the round so secure the win.
</p><p>Big cheers to Tjockis for sticking in there and finishing 2nd even though he was suicided 3 times and fireballed once and bounced I think three times, and helped with all wonders etc. Very nice comeback by Flanders as well after being trippled early with a fast race. Andy too for another nice round finish, you have really established yourself now as a top player! Ofcourse thanks to Zedijar and Dreki too for sticking it out even if things went badly. Zedijar, you didnt have an easy job with Orcs after the nerf. We wanted to have one in case WE turned out to be bad mofos late game so it was nice of you to try them on!
</p><p>Special kudos also to Mav &amp; co for trying a very different strat with them halfers. You had us terrified there for a while, that's why we tried to choke the round down just after your conversions. Some more fast hits for you at that stage and you could have become really hairy!
