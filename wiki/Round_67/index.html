<p>We did it, again! How come I ended on top? There are a few things that were more important than others and I will try and remember them here.
</p><p>Our pack consisted of me (Smoking Lightbulbs), Fingal (Smiling Dictator), Lightning (The Expert DJ Love Story), Mris (Cherry), Bond (Roid Rage) and Mogsmav (r3b0rn). We were lucky to end up in the same realm as Web (Killer Kute Kats) and also Chris (Baggins). The plan was to play burn out strats and try to run for it, if we failed we would have some weeks without dominion. Everyone came oop 700ish acres with nice economy. My lyc was w1 with 2.8k op and 4.3k dp.
</p><p>One can say I had the worst oop I ever had. due to clerics being changed and taliums not updated with the changes I bounced by 6 op on my first hit which left me with basically nothing left so I just made a small BF. I was not very happy about it and felt my dom had a really bad start. Everyone else in the pack had an okish oop and gained some decent hits with bond and lighty in the front seat with big gains and massive op on their kobbos. I was really lucky and was the first to hit a farm kobbo 12hours out, he was 800 acres or so with 2.5k dp or something like that so I hit him twice for a total of 181 acres iirc. Those hits really put me back in the race and I was quite happy at the time. Us lycs decided to build max shrines as fast as we could since shrines was overpowered this round which was pointed out a couple of times by my packies before the round started.
</p><p>oop results:

</p><p>7 out of top 10.
</p><p>After this we just kept hitting every 12hrs for as much land and converts as we could and we were all doing well. The competition at the time was realm #5 and #31 who were also playing fast. #5 FW and Liz kept pushing specs and mods and were top op at the time with #31 lycs going for a more efficient build with DM's and more WW than us. We all defended them at the time so their op push was kind of pointless and we just kept hitting every 12. Our 2 kobbos kept training op to keep #5 from going overboard on op and that helped a lot. There was a spud that was doing kind of good at the time and he sent a message to one of our kobbos that he didn't want to keep playing and that he would try and suicide either BG's or Rio. A couple of days later he would suicide.
</p><p>That was the turning point #1. The spud messaged realm 5 that he would suicide a specific hour and realm 5 took advantage and gained a big lead in land and pez while they were still spec and mod whoring. this happened very late at night euro-time so lightning was asleep unfortunately since he could have hit one of FW/Liz. Mris had also trained up huge op at the time and the farming had perfect timing since #5 would have had to sit and train more dp to hit again. There was a lot of whining about the farming on the boards and people from within realm 5 pack even backed up the accusations (good job!) and Ross took action and suspended realm 5 FW and Liz (Burnt+Ivetza).
</p><p>This opened up the door for us and 31 lycs. 31 was looking to be in better shape than us, they had less op but a better build and military composition and more pez. I managed to get up in the front seat op/dp wise with some scavs and was looking rather good. #5 decided to suicide mris who was big and had shown he wasn't afraid to train massive amounts of spec op. after that they decided to sink #31 top lyc which was quite good for us since then we only needed to defend one of them and also could send out light hoping he'd take the bait and we could finish him off. Unfortunately (turned out great in the end) mogsmav was at a party and I assume was a bit drunk sent out thinking both lycs in #31 was sunk, that was not the case and the smaller lyc in #31 hit mogs for some decent acres and converts. I was awake at the time but noone else from the pack was on so I didn't really know what to do. I figured quite fast that I was a bit short hitting the lyc. closer to the end of the hour I got another CS and pasted in the taliums calc and saw I suddenly could hit him, I had no idea that #5 had sui/razed him so I was thinking calc was messing up. I recalced and got really close to HC and I missed the chance to retal #31 the same hour that he sent. Packies were dropping in on irc after I send SMS to most of them and we decided on a course of action. If I was to release my wiz I could stay safe from #31 on his return so I hit him and released my wiz and drafted up. I think 2 more from our pack followed the hit. #31 thought the race was over as one of the lycs was sunk and the other one trippled so they deleted soon after. the players left in #31 thought they would try and stop me as I was top attacker at the time and decided to fireball me. That worked quite well for them since I had just released all my wiz (except one! who managed to repel quite a few FBs). I was kept on 10kish pez for 36hrs and that gave Web enough time to pass me in military.
</p><p>top attacking dominions at this time:
Rank Dominion Realm Land
</p><p>1 Killer Kute Kats 19 2,677
</p><p>2 cherry 19 2,385
</p><p>3 Smoking Lightbulbs 19 2,372
</p><p>4 The Smiling Dictator 19 2,253
</p><p>5 r3b0rn 19 1,913
</p><p>6 The Expert DJ Love Story 19 1,853
</p><p>We had all started to build some DM's and Web decided to stop shrines since we were hitting a lot less now, I kept mine after discussing it with Lightning. That should prove to be a very wise move for me in the end. We ended up with me and Web on basically same military and land which started to kill us, we both sat waiting for the same targets to get in range and there just wasn't enough people to hit. then Mris came up with the idea that I should bottomfeed to get a land lead and sit on high acres building massive military and let Web take care of the 75% dominions entering range. So I left EG and started to bottomfeed as much as I could, trying to hit good land type targets and people that would give nice converts. I bottomfed as much as I could and had a ~1k acre lead. It took me about 3 days to build all land I had conquered and was just shy of 60k pez when I was done. Shrines was the best building I could have had at this stage, I gained op on all my hits due to the converts I got. Eventually both Fingal and Web followed on the bottomfeeding but it hurt them more than me but especially Web since he had stopped shrines.
</p><p>I sat at my current land just building massive amounts of garous and waited for someone to enter range. Anders who played a converting kobbo was the only one even close to my range that I possibly could break. eventually when he had trained troops for 10 days he was able to make his first grab and enter my range. I got his ops once he entered and he had 334k dp vs me or so and I only had 314k op max 5:4 at the time. I thought I was too far off and wouldn't be able to get him but a couple of hours later I checked to see what he was spending his plat on and he was building homes only and no military at all. That's when I decided to pump rats to increase my 5:4 for a possible hit 12hrs later. When the hr came I got his ops to see how close it was and I was just short hitting him 2-3k or so. We were discussing weather Fingal should raze him to let me make the hit but Mris suggested me to release spy/wiz to increase 5:4 and so I did and hit him. I got massive converts and good land types of this hit. 
</p><p>Now I again was in the situation that i had to sit and wait for new dominions to enter range after surviving the top 2-6 OP that was still in our realm. That wasn't very likely to happen and the two explorers in range had a lot of dp and better pez so I didn't have any chance to outtrain them. Then i decided to bottomfeed again to fast increase my allin dp and also gain op on each hit. I hit as many as I could and reached 7.2k acres or so and just sat there and built the land that was on usefull land types. It was at this stage realm 1 started to get strong with their massive imps and efficient build. Mris who had decided to be a blackopper trained to 10 WPA and we wared realm 1 to lightningball the troll and orc in #1. He was quite successfull and their imps lowered quite a bit, eventually Web ate a "sui" from the troll as payback I assume. Since troll and orc were getting so strong Lightning decided to sit on his current acres and pump op to keep them from getting into my range. He managed to keep them from hitting and not becoming strong enough in time.
</p><p>The last days we figured we could probably pull off a 3-way tie between me, fingal and web so fingal started bottomfeeding to catch up to me while web released op to explore to my acres. unfortunately realm 1 troll decided to hit fingal while he was out on a bottomfeed and troll in return ate 2 hits from lightning and mogsmav. This was the time burnt stepped into the round again and suicided Lubo's account on a massive sui/farmout/raze on lightning lowering his dp with 18k making lightning hittable by realm 1 human and dwarf (Lubo's halfer got scripted). On trolls return he also hit lightning and by doing so he gave me the chance to hit the realm #1 orc who was out on some hit on a woody and was also 2nd top NW and biggest attacker outside our realm.
</p><p>That just about sums it up, I know I missed out on mentioning realm 27 but they only had an impact on our training for a few days and they eventually had to train so much dp that they were no threats any more unable to send in our range. If the round had been more even in the top I bet they could have finished better than they did.
</p><p>I want to thank everyone in our pack for the great effort and also those in the realm that helped out, we could not have done it whithout you!
</p><p>Baggins - great guy! always helpfull and willing to send his MT's to death to get us ops on basically all halfers.
</p><p>Web/Al - Glad you landed with us in the end, you played an awesome round and listened to advice! Congrats on 2nd place!&nbsp;:)
</p><p>Mogsmav - one of the coolest guys I've met in dominion, would love to pack you again! congrats on 3rd place.
Lightning - Always glad to have you by my side mate, your efforts and advice are invaluable.
</p><p>Mris - I don't know any better numbercruncher in dominion and all your sheets are always helpfull. Glad you stayed and helped me to this finish.
</p><p>Lutz - What can I say, I would have loved to tie for your 3rd win. Same race between you and me = guaranteed pwnage&nbsp;;)
</p><p>Bond - I don't know if anyone can match this man, he is the best even if you suck at dominion&nbsp;:P Love you!
</p><p>Ladeda - thanks for all the sims and ideas and also thank you for not playing since I'd have finished 2nd if that was the case.
</p><p>PS. Doing logins from phone while GF is giving birth to our 3rd kid was a new experience and I think this game has its grip around my balls&nbsp;:) DS.
