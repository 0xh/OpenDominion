<p>Get yourself a beverage, get comfortable and allow me to tell you the tale of #16 and #29, a tale woven with triumph, heartache, honor and deceit. This is the Round 74 Recap.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Pre-Round:
</p><p>Our pack this was essentially the same as last round with the addition of Petra in place of Lorian.
</p><p>Faith went human, playing his version of my 8k DM heavy Human from last imp round, but adapting the name of his Sylvan that rd (Battle Rain)
</p><p>I played a teched converter WE (Velveeta Village)
</p><p>Takao wanted WE but since I had ‘called it’ first he went for an oop attacking gobbo converter (Back in time)
</p><p>Kuki was LDE sylvan (The real McCoy)
</p><p>Petra’s plan was to imitate Lorian’s masonry LDA strat from Rd66 (Mercredi)
</p><p>Vance went for a teched gnome converter with big imps, a similar strategy to Petra’s without the slow start. I think he had the best strat of any of us, but got hit too many times.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>When the round began, we realized that we had another four-pack in the realm, so we knew we had potential for a big round.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Boss played a converting human (Once Upon a Time)
</p><p>Gary (Victoria Falls), (Una Salus Victus) and (Heavens Forest) had solid finishes considered they each made ~6-8 wonder sends
</p><p><br />
</p><p>First Week:
</p><p>The initial threat at OOP was #9 for the sheer fact that they had so many fast attackers. #16 had three big attackers, but were running better strats. The DE’s in each realm were the biggest threats.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Meanwhile in #29, Takao’s low dp attacking strat allowed him to get doubled for 88 acres. I mention this because it was quite a long conversation to convince him not to delete. He decided to stick around to help the pack with wonders and ops.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Battle 1: Russian Roulette (#16) vs Drogon (#9)
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Day 7: #16 wars #9 to snare DE (Drogon) to slow him down, and possibly FB someone, which is Vhagar the halfer who just took a big land lead; Oment, 16 fw, gets snared and robbed
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Day 7-8: 9's DE makes a huge grab on 16's DE, the halfer retaliates with a sui and gets tripled, then hits the DE a second time; 16 DE hits one of the guys that hit the halfer, but 9's DE comes back for more, this time Oment, the 16 fw steps in to make a safe hit and their DE follows and finally gets some retribution
</p><p><br />
</p><p>8:59:56 PM Russian roulette (# 16) invaded Drogon (# 9) and captured 117 land.
</p><p>8:59:53 AM slow.internet.guy (# 16) invaded Drogon (# 9) and captured 102 land.
</p><p>8:58:48 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Drogon (# 9) conquered 132 land from Russian roulette (# 16).
</p><p>8:58:34 AM Chicken Pox (# 16) invaded Drogon (# 9) and captured 134 land.
</p><p>5:42:41 AM Russian roulette (# 16) invaded Meraxes (# 9) and captured 97 land.
</p><p>12:59:44 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Rhaegal (# 9) conquered 74 land from Chicken Pox (# 16).
</p><p>8:59:59 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Meraxes (# 9) conquered 83 land from Chicken Pox (# 16).
</p><p>8:59:31 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Vhagar (# 9) conquered 90 land from Chicken Pox (# 16).
</p><p>8:55:57 PM Chicken Pox (# 16) invaded Drogon (# 9) and captured 98 land.
</p><p>4:00:16 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Drogon (# 9) conquered 112 land from Russian roulette (# 16).
</p><p><br />
</p><p>To sum it up, the big winners were slow.internet.guy (#16) +153, Vhagar (#9) +135, Rhaegal (#9) +111. Gothia (Chicken Pox #16) and Drogon (#9) were essentially killed in the exchange. Surprisingly, no other realms participated in the exchange. 
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Day 8:
</p><p>Vhagar 9 Halfling 1,526 116,698
</p><p>Lui Lekkerland 20 Goblin 1,403 71,315
</p><p>The Prince 25 Kobold 1,388 85,889
</p><p>Awkward 4 Goblin 1,378 78,965
</p><p>This is My Ninja Way 23 Lizardfolk 1,357 117,005
</p><p>Blue Angel 28 Kobold 1,353 85,541
</p><p>Chopped Ice 35 Icekin 1,353 78,299
</p><p>Auf Wiedersehen 15 Kobold 1,335 84,402
</p><p>Turtle 22 Human 1,333 78,998
</p><p>Coach Ella 9 Halfling 1,325 73,292
</p><p>Archimedes Death Ray 24 Merfolk 1,322 111,402
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Day 11:
</p><p>Vhagar 9 Halfling 1,994 179,869 51/52, 13k, modded like crazy, trying to runaway
</p><p>Lui Lekkerland 20 Goblin 1,911 108,370
</p><p>Awkward 4 Goblin 1,904 120,885
</p><p>The Prince 25 Kobold 1,895 136,493
</p><p>slow.internet.guy 16 Firewalker 1,870 197,817 46/51, 16k
</p><p>Russian roulette 16 Dark Elf 1,866 193,259
</p><p>Archimedes Death Ray 24 Merfolk 1,865 184,509
</p><p>This is My Ninja Way 23 Lizardfolk 1,830 185,094
</p><p>Moonlight Mile 8 Goblin 1,820 118,080
</p><p>Sunshine 12 Kobold 1,784 139,878
</p><p><br />
</p><p>One of the more interesting parts of the round was Vhagar’s attempt to run away. His huge mods and spec heavy offense allowed him to get some quick hits in and gain a large lead. For reasons only known to him, he chose not to build those acres and instead sat on under 10k pez.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Meanwhile in #29, we were engaged in a 4-realm battle with #4 for the Library. Interestingly enough the realms were #27, #28, #29, and #30. #28 would be the victors
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Day 16: I'm 41st, 25k pez, 8 techs, 78k income, 94k dp
</p><p>Lui Lekkerland 20 Goblin 2,638 172,085
</p><p>The Prince 25 Kobold 2,595 214,397
</p><p>Awkward 4 Goblin 2,524 185,910
</p><p>Vhagar 9 Halfling 2,506 281,494 77/86, 9% reduction, 10k pez
</p><p>Auf Wiedersehen 15 Kobold 2,465 207,269
</p><p>Archimedes Death Ray 24 Merfolk 2,459 269,616 55k op yesterday, not sure how he’s keeping up
</p><p>Russian roulette 16 Dark Elf 2,419 311,200 84/93, 4%, 15k
</p><p>The Invadinator 16 Goblin 2,397 197,992 38k pez, 800 DMs and 25% masonries, might be the biggest threat right now
</p><p>The Three Graces 34 Firewalker 2,362 199,644 33.7k pez
</p><p>Wolfen 2 Kobold 2,334 190,720
</p><p>Crystal 9 Kobold 2,320 204,752
</p><p>Back in time 29 Goblin 2,310 178,505 Takao is on a complete tear right now, despite getting hit twice oop
</p><p>genuit sacra lumina 19 Halfling 2,290 165,275
</p><p>Dragonhawk Rider 26 Human 2,290 187,692
</p><p>slow.internet.guy 16 Firewalker 2,288 316,233 81/93, 7%, 13k
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Day 18: As Vhagar slowly died, not with a bang, but with a whimper, a new threat arose, Blue Angel (#28), a quick convert kobo. #16 snared him and made the all-in grab, end of story
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Day 20: Meanwhile in #29, we managed to steal Library from #28 about 24h after they took it down from #4. We were only able to hold it for a day before #28 took it back.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Day 22: With people stuck behind halfer while he trained huge op and had no pez, 16 made steady hits with decent income, 24 had great efficiency but couldn’t keep up with modders
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Russian roulette 16 Dark Elf 3,622 483,867 Jumped up here two days ago
</p><p>Lui Lekkerland 20 Goblin 3,616 267,815
</p><p>slow.internet.guy 16 Firewalker 3,593 479,248 Made two grabs while Russian keeps everyone home
</p><p>Awkward 4 Goblin 3,422 282,660
</p><p>The Invadinator 16 Goblin 3,351 261,188
</p><p>Auf Wiedersehen 15 Kobold 3,335 321,971
</p><p>Crystal 9 Kobold 3,270 309,103
</p><p>The Three Graces 34 Firewalker 3,265 301,086
</p><p>The Prince 25 Kobold 3,246 419,766 Converting
</p><p>Vhagar 9 Halfling 3,105 389,096
</p><p>Sunshine 12 Kobold 3,076 344,983
</p><p>This is My Ninja Way 23 Lizardfolk 3,052 424,643
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Day 23: This is My Ninja Way (#23) makes the biggest hit of the round to this point against The Invadinator (#16) for 306 acres, who I thought was the top late game threat at the time. A significant hit.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Day 26: Faith (Battle Rain #29) made his first hit at 2.8k
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Day 27: What looked to be the makings of a two headed runaway, went sour for Oment (#16 fw) when he was suicide by Rhaegal (#9) for 374 and bounced on Prince (#25), who made his first send.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Day 29: The following events affected the course of the round in multiple ways.
</p><p>I (Velveeta Village #29) had made my first hit at 2.9k acres, leaving safe dp.
</p><p>Blue Angel (#28) suicides Oment (16 fw) for 405 acres
</p><p>Three trolls, Tetre (Napoleon Bonaparte #16), Mucho #16 and T r o l o l o #27 all made easy hits on the suiciding kobo despite being about halfway through their conversions.
</p><p>Oment, now with access to smaller targets hit me for 196 acres, costing me two full days of training and building. I wonder how the round might have turned out had I not lost those two days.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Before the action:
</p><p>Russian roulette 16 Dark Elf 5,135 720,751
</p><p>Lui Lekkerland 20 Goblin 4,758 374,925
</p><p>Awkward 4 Goblin 4,390 393,390

</p><p>This is My Ninja Way 23 Lizardfolk 4,027 624,039
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Day 33: It was around here that we took our second wonder, City of Gold, which we would hold for most of the round.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Battle 2: Russian Roulette (#16) vs This is My Ninja Way (#23)
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Day 36: The cold war arms race between the DE and the liz led them to a point where they could both hit each other all-in. The tick before the DE was going to hit the liz, Ninja sui’d, hitting the DE for 629 acres and farming out. Nearly every other attacker in the game made hits today.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Day 37:
</p><p>Russian roulette 16 Dark Elf 7,065 1,083,199 355/291, 4%, 39k
</p><p>Lui Lekkerland 20 Goblin 6,123 572,795

</p><p>Velveeta Village 29 Wood Elf 4,056 851,599 27th largest, 5th strongest; 228/280, 43k, 145k income
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Battle 3: The realm of (#29) vs Napoleon Bonaparte (#16)
</p><p>Day 38-41: Riding the coattails of the DE, Tetre (Napoleon) began making a series of ares-off hits against kobbos. Since Faith and I were #2 and #3 op’s respectively, we knew we needed to stop Tetre before he joined or surpassed the DE on top. We all got our ratios up to 1.0+ and warred #16. At some point #16 either noticed or caught wind of what we were training and got their ratio’s up as well. The snaring on Napoleon was a complete failure, but Takao and to a lesser extent Boss and Faith did an effective job of FBing totaling up 55k pez kills. We also assassinated ~2,300 wiz.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Day 41: We still have war active with #16
</p><p>Russian roulette 16 Dark Elf 7,145 1,309,756 441/371, 4%, 46k

</p><p><br />
</p><p>Velveeta Village 29 Wood Elf 4,463 1,047,919 #3 nw #29 largest, 310/317, 37k pez
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Day 43: Perhaps the most controversial part of the round. #16 DE messaged Takao and offered to intentionally bounce (undying op) to allow Faith to hit Tetre (Napoleon) who was out, thinking he was covered. The reason wasn't that he was afraid of getting passed, it was that all of Tetre's hit were sketchy and he may have been responsible for the second sui on Oment earlier on which fed the trolls nicely
</p><p><br />
</p><p>10:58:15 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Napoleon Bonaparte (# 16) conquered 337 land from The Prince (# 25).
</p><p>All'in; Was paid to 6.6k acres, which would have put him 3rd and 2200 acres behind Gothia
</p><p><br />
</p><p>5:20:42 PM Sadly, the forces of Russian roulette (# 16) were beaten back by Forest Mirage (# 28).
</p><p>Portals and cavs allowed DE and Faith to send and return the same hours
</p><p><br />
</p><p>5:40:59 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Battle Rain (# 29) conquered 504 land from Napoleon Bonaparte (# 16).
</p><p>Sent 4500 knights!
</p><p><br />
</p><p>6:08:19 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Velveeta Village (# 29) conquered 467 land from Napoleon Bonaparte (# 16).
</p><p>Had to r/r 263 acres in 2h, good thing I had 250k combined income and CC
</p><p><br />
</p><p>1:19:09 AM Fellow dominion Velveeta Village (# 29) fended off an attack from WoodOfSteal (# 16).
</p><p>Huge r/r (15%, 1.8m plat) but supposedly bounced because he thought war was active, I thought he was razing for the DE to all-in me when my non-forest acres came in
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Day 44: The results of the hits on Tetre was that Faith got a free hit when he was already in DE’s range and with Napoleon out of the way, it was down to the DE and potentially 27 troll. I have gained 1700 acres in the last three days, allowing my economy to match Faith’s. Faith had been sitting up near 71k pez and 260k income for a while. After sitting on 45k for a while, I exploded up to 73k and 290k (incl lumber). With the DE making half of what we were making, we figured there was a definite chance to catch him. He had huge offense, but was trained to 5:4 and his dp wasn’t that high. Coupled with the fact that DE is a horrible bf race with no turtle, the plan was to force the DE to train defense for the rest of the round until we could take Portals down.

</p><p><br />Thanks to my realm for a great round. We landed with a 2nd pack, which made things look promising from the start. From my pack special thanks to Takao, for finding all 3 of my hits the last day, and turning into the ops guy halfway through the round. Sauce, Vance, kuki - it was a pleasure to play with you guys again. Boss and Petra - great to be together for the first time (especially Boss as we have always been competing against each other in this and other games) Couldn't have done it without all of the help, ops, wonder hits, and ideas we discussed in chat. I decided to do a high imp converting strat and didn't run techs for the first time in quite a while. I peaked about 71k peasants and 260k income at two points after conversion.
</p><p><br />Well played round by 16 and good move at the end by releasing. I was going to hit you as soon as we took the portals. After playing a respectable round I am glad you will still get a high finish.

</p><p><br />Awesome round, my second 8.2k converter in four rounds, beat my previous best by about 20 acres. I hope it's enough for 3rd. Wonder where i'd have finished if I hadn't lost 2 days from Oment's hit. One of the funniest moments was when I peaked at 73k pez, I had 18k jobs needed, something like 70% employment.
</p><p><br />Unbelievable pack this rd. Takao is our MVP, calcing up ten guys per day it seemed, black opping our competition and always being around. It was fun being on top with Faith again, just like Rd71, but on the same side this time. Vance, Boss, Kuki, Petra, Gary and the rest of his pack. You guys all helped to make it happen, I hope you enjoy this final day as much as I am. Much respect to 16 DE, still don't know who you were!
</p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Round_Loss_Story"> Round Loss Story </span></h1>
<p>Well, that’s not the result I was expecting to be writing this to. Firstly, congratulations to Faith. Well played. The rest of you who think they deserve kudos… Just read the story.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>For the record, our DE was Lightning, who played with Erik/bond/fingal/ladeda (and some others) previously on the wins in R64 and 67. I know half of Dom expected it to be Erik and I heard some people were assuming it was ladeda, but it wasn’t.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>There were no changes in our pack from the previous round, so strategy talk started pretty early. Lightning really liked DE and went garg/SW with them (Russian roulette). Erik took Halfer, hoping to emulate his R70 successes (Chicken Pox). Both of them would be going fast out of the gate. I took FW with a general gameplan of going slower than the others with an idea of going for more elite D by the time I hit 10k spec D (slow.internet.guy). Imperion took Gobbo, hitting once OOP and once at W6+14, then explore and reconvert later (The Invadinator). Bond took Troll (Mucho Badasstico) and Daniel took WE (WoodOfSteal). We planned to war once or twice to get rid of competition, so the explorers would be FBing early on and snares were on the menu for day 7.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Protection was boring, couple of screw-ups in pack notwithstanding. We had another Troll in there, who turned out to be tetre in the end. Day 3 revealed likely top threats in 9, who looked to be doing at least four fast attackers, possibly more. They also warred #14 on day 3, which absolutely demolished #14 and gave 9 a fair boost. Other threats weren’t really clear, but given who was in #14, it’s likely that they would’ve been a good threat.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>OOP went fair for all of us, in a low-key way. Lightning gained 163a on a Sylvan, Erik had a lousy 100a and I ended up with 126a. Daniel also managed to somehow change his sim so that he ended up as top Dom on 806a or so. A suicider in 28 – I heard it was Sylar? - made things interesting. He hit #9 Viserion, who was a 700a huge alch FW. That pretty much took him out right from the word go as his economy never really recovered. Despite him gone, 9 was basically the prime threat at first. Their Halfer and DE were right on top and their Liz and Kobbo not too far behind. War target was set on 9 pretty soon, with snare going to DE and FB later decided.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>We didn’t have a lot of top OP early. 9 had all of it past day 5, with their Halfer going huge mods. The DE had been playing with huge drafts for most of day 6, but we still managed to semi-miss his dump of 800 Swords, coinciding with lighty’s return on day 7. It turns out it wasn’t so much of a planned kill, but it was still dangerous. War was on, and in no-time we snared the DE and unleashed fireballs on the Halfer, whose pez took a minor dive to 7k from 10-11k.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Unfortunately, 9 also had two explorers with decent spies which meant I was also snared, albeit less than their DE. The DE ended up hitting Lighty at the start of the hour, and Erik sacrificed himself to hit the DE in return. He ended up getting tripled by 9, but it took the DE down. Lightning also did a small Swordies push of his own and ended up hitting Meraxes in 9, who was another threat and out on Erik just a wee bit light. DE was still top OP, but without turtle and without Ares, he was easy pickings for Erik again when war became active. He immediately (14 seconds) retaliated on lighty, but I managed to follow on the DE, while being snared and without Ares.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Day 7:
</p><p>8:52:24 AM We have declared WAR on Rise of the Dragons (# 9)!
</p><p>4:00:16 PM Drogon (# 9) invaded Russian roulette (# 16) and captured 112 land.
</p><p>8:55:57 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Chicken Pox (# 16) conquered 98 land from Drogon (# 9).
</p><p>8:59:31 PM Vhagar (# 9) invaded Chicken Pox (# 16) and captured 90 land.
</p><p>8:59:59 PM Meraxes (# 9) invaded Chicken Pox (# 16) and captured 83 land.
</p><p>Day 8:
</p><p>12:59:44 AM Rhaegal (# 9) invaded Chicken Pox (# 16) and captured 74 land.
</p><p>5:42:41 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Russian roulette (# 16) conquered 97 land from Meraxes (# 9).
</p><p>8:58:34 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Chicken Pox (# 16) conquered 134 land from Drogon (# 9).
</p><p>8:58:48 AM Drogon (# 9) invaded Russian roulette (# 16) and captured 132 land.
</p><p>8:59:53 AM Victorious on the battlefield, slow.internet.guy (# 16) conquered 102 land from Drogon (# 9).
</p><p>1:59:32 PM This is My Ninja Way (# 23) invaded Chicken Pox (# 16) and captured 82 land.
</p><p>8:59:56 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Russian roulette (# 16) conquered 117 land from Drogon (# 9).
</p><p><br />
</p><p>I should have died there. I was three hours away from casting Ares; four after a snare just after HC did some more, but I wasn’t snared at all after that, and that was it. DE was pretty much dead, Kobbo was crippled, my Dom was back up after stagnating for 40h and Lightning had also managed to get 9 to take mostly barren, so all was good there.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>The Swords push also meant that next to nobody could hit into our realm safely without copping a hit themselves.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Unfortunately, some people have too much DP for their own good, which meant that #23 was able to make that safe hit. This effectively ended Erik’s attacking and he decided to unconvert and reconvert at a later stage.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Day 9 was when #14 also warred 9, presumably for revenge, and along with #28 chipping in, just about everyone in 9 copped FBs. The Halfer and Liz ended up making FHs which countered the FBs, but it slowed them a bit. Liz ended up going with a fast 200 DM, Halfer went for more mods. He had over 35&#160;% combined GT/Temp/GN on day 11 or something like that. There were no really apparent other threats just yet, apart from one, so all we had to do at that point was to hang on and outlast the Halfer, and kill the next threat.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>The next threat was a Lizardfolk in #23: This Is My Ninja Way. He turned out to be Kenshiro. He went for an extremely fast 500 DM and no mods and he kept up nicely while 9 and us were busy beating the stuffing out of each other. He ended up as our next FB target once the war with 9 was over and was promptly FBd down to 7k pez for about 24h. It took him another 18h to emerge on 19k peasants after he’d built FHs. He hadn’t been able to train a lot and his Keep was still increasing, so his peasants were huge at that point in the game. Lightning and I were playing around with 12-14k peasants at most at the time, so his lead was substantial. He did trail in OP a lot.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>We switched to some Lightning Bolts, but those don’t do a lot early on, so Kenshiro wasn’t as down and out as we’d hoped. At this point, I’d completed my 400 Alchs and both lighty and I were starting on DM tentatively. Unfortunately, unlike the war with 9, we couldn’t get a war hit.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>All this time, 9 Vhagar was pushing and pushing and pushing mods. He skipped building anything but mods and the essential smithies/farms etc, which meant a run-or-bust strat with his Halfer. He couldn’t stop and build because he’d fall behind. Even so, he was legitimately within one or two moves of running at all points, forcing lightning to train a lot of DP and forcing me to tail his sends. For a good bit of the second and third week, that was all we did: defend 9 halfer. However, all things must come to an end, and on day 18, Vhagar made his last hit, hitting #32 Goblin ladeda. After that, it took him 17 days to send again – and that was on a wonder too. Still, it was a very nicely played strat, albeit one that didn’t run. Good game.&#160;:)
</p><p><br />
</p><p>A third threat emerged once we hit 2200a, right around the time 9 started to die off: 28 Blue Angel, whose Kobold converted with 20&#160;% GT and an absolutely staggering 12&#160;% temples. He went massive Underlings to hit up 1k acres in 4 days or something. By this time, Lighty had all-but overtaken Halfer and I’d grabbed MG to get on par. 28 was playing it very safe too. He could have suicided 9 at least twice by my count, and I’m sure lightning never was completely safe, but Blue Angel played it safe every time. He couldn’t hit one of us – he’d get doubled in return.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>We ended up shifting our attention to 28. He had made two quick hits that left him on shaky all-in, and we sealed the deal with a snare + 2k Swords dump by lighty on day 20.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>1:53:54 AM We have declared WAR on We have a wonder now&#160;:) (# 28)!
</p><p>10:59:22 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Russian roulette (# 16) conquered 252 land from Blue Angel (# 28).
</p><p><br />
</p><p>He also spent time trying to convince Lightning of not hitting him and doing a NAP for the win. Yeah, as if. Tetre also chipped in, saying 28 was his friend and that we shouldn’t hurt him. Again, no dice.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Oddly, the idea of training spies to get out of being snared just didn’t seem to be fashionable. 9 didn’t train any and 28 spent his time training Beasts and UL mainly. Only when we were nearly done with the entire war – on day 22 – did he start to train spies in great numbers. Too bad for him we still kept him snared until the end of the war early day 23.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>The day we canceled the war, we missed that Kenshiro had huge OP freed up by Lightning hitting out of range by hitting #24 Merfolk earlier in the day. A little assassinating later and our Goblin – ImperioN – who was in absolutely hugely good shape, got hit.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>4:59:45 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Russian roulette (# 16) conquered 202 land from Archimedes Death Ray (# 24)
</p><p>3:28:30 PM This is My Ninja Way (# 23) invaded The Invadinator (# 16) and captured 306 land.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>We weren’t pleased about that at all, but we soldiered on. This is also around the time when I ended up getting asked about #35 Chopped Ice, who had been hit three times by us in short succession. Truth be told, I have no idea who that was. All I know is that he explored into range of Lightning while being 15k DP short or something. The other hits on him were a little closer, but 4k drafts do not good DP make when there’s an exploring Halfling in your range and you’re only safe by 700 DP.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Day 25 was when I managed to get myself out of the race by bouncing on #25 Prince. Long story short, I rushed a send and I used wrong ops. I repeated myself on day 29 as well. Oops.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Day 27 was when Rhaegal in #9 finally played his sui-card. We’d been expecting it for some time, to be honest, but it still hurt. By this point, lightning had only two attackers in range: 25 Prince since I’d failed to knock him out and Kenshiro. The rest of the realm greatly profited and I managed to get a back to back hit on Chopped Ice, so all was well.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Lightning managed to get #9 Crystal on day 28 for some neat acres. Oddly, he hadn’t even started converting but he still had GN. More on that later…
</p><p><br />
</p><p>1:59:57 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Russian roulette (# 16) conquered 310 land from Crystal (# 9).
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Then on day 29. I bounced again, same target, same type of mistake and all that rot, and I ended up on the wrong end of a ~5k spy/wiz release into suicide by #28 Blue Angel.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>11:10:40 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Blue Angel (# 28) conquered 405 land from slow.internet.guy (# 16).
</p><p>11:12:19 AM The Prince (# 25) invaded Blue Angel (# 28) and captured 228 land.
</p><p>11:13:12 AM Napoleon Bonaparte (# 16) invaded Blue Angel (# 28) and captured 228 land.
</p><p>11:14:07 AM T r o l o l o (# 27) invaded Blue Angel (# 28) and captured 204 land.
</p><p>11:15:52 AM Wolfen (# 2) invaded Blue Angel (# 28) and captured 173 land.
</p><p>11:49:21 AM Mucho Badasstico (# 16) invaded Blue Angel (# 28) and captured 167 land.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>This one made it onto the boards, I think. It also raised more than a few questions.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>I managed to recover by hitting #29 Velveeta Village. Sauce wasn’t pleased, saying I could’ve hit any of the ones who hit #28 as well, but we were low on SS at that point after trying to get Viserion in 9 – he released enough to make me not hit him. Chances were I could’ve hit, but getting a good enough BS was going to be tricky on our low SS.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Fountain of Youth finally came out on day 32, which meant that we coordinated our way into sending on it. This boosted pop some more, but by this time the second tier had to start watching out as #29 Battle Rain was powering up the ranks on a very powerful 900 DM strat.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Skip to day 34 and we had another hit for Lightning and war.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>2:59:57 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Russian roulette (# 16) conquered 288 land from GJHoldings Inc (# 18).
</p><p>10:56:23 AM Golden Dragons (# 9) has declared WAR on us!
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Tetre ended up being blackopped, but he doubled on #9 Meraxes to get out of range of the blackops. 9 ended up taking the Fountain eventually. Lightning also made a hit on day 35, saying goodbye to yet another exploring / ever-converting Kobold with GN:
</p><p><br />
</p><p>12:59:57 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Russian roulette (# 16) conquered 356 land from Auf Wiedersehen (# 15).
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Then the second incident that made it onto the boards this round. Kenshiro had been following Lightning for a few days, but by this point, he was falling behind hard and required AC to be safe all-in. Lightning dumped about 5k Swordsmen to catch him, and when Kenshiro noticed, he decided to turn the tables:
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Day 36:
</p><p>10:59:46 AM This is My Ninja Way (# 23) invaded Russian roulette (# 16) and captured 629 land.
</p><p>11:00:32 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Russian roulette (# 16) conquered 335 land from This is My Ninja Way (# 23).
</p><p>11:59:29 AM Victorious on the battlefield, slow.internet.guy (# 16) conquered 340 land from This is My Ninja Way (# 23).
</p><p>12:00:00 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Mucho Badasstico (# 16) conquered 382 land from This is My Ninja Way (# 23).
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Well played Kenshiro. I’ve heard cheating allegations, but fact remains that you were also playing a very nice round that only got superseded by our DE.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>I also got hit again, this time by Battle Rain who sent 3600 Knights along, but with literally everyone out and Kenshiro scripted a few hours after sending, his 252k + incoming was sufficient to hit my 282k.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>4:46:36 PM Battle Rain (# 29) invaded slow.internet.guy (# 16) and captured 440 land.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Kenshiro had also sent messages around to others, which meant that #25 Prince was around to profit. Since Lightning was still assuming it was an all-in and he was on phone, his Dominion revolted for sending over 5:4. This allowed Prince to sneak in a hit 2 sec before Lightning, to his detriment. He landed in range on about 15k DP short, which led to:
</p><p><br />
</p><p>11:30:52 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Russian roulette (# 16) conquered 345 land from The Prince (# 25).
</p><p><br />
</p><p>We replied to losing the Fountain by declaring war for Portals of Transportation, which negated the advantage that Lightning’s main competitor – Battle Rain – would have. Tetre also ended up slamming #9 Crystal twice on day 37:
</p><p><br />
</p><p>4:01:16 AM We have declared WAR on realm 11 needs more lube, Ouch (# 1)!
</p><p>6:26:39 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Napoleon Bonaparte (# 16) conquered 414 land from Crystal (# 9).
</p><p>6:12:23 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Napoleon Bonaparte (# 16) conquered 287 land from Crystal (# 9).
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Both hits were ACless. Just after we got Portals of Transportation on day 38, we noticed a build-up of spies and wiz on Battle Rain, when he already had enough to get ops on everyone in his range. Checking others revealed huge incoming spy/wiz and with their and our position being what it was, I assumed it was for blackops on Tetre, so we alerted him to that. It slowed him down quite a bit, but 29’s initial impact was blunted. They could’ve done a lot more damage had they warred on day 38 instead of day 39. I decided to unconvert and return the favour a bit: it was that or train up to 90&#160;% DR and still not hit anyway.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Nothing much happened for a few days apart from blackops flying to and fro, and mostly to us. Well, Rush warred us on Day 41: 8:30:04 AM TREMBLE IN FEAR YOU GUYS (# 42) has declared WAR on us!
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Then, Tetre managed another hit on a Kobold, also without AC, also one of those Kobolds doing the ever-converting strategy with some 150-200 GN - #12 Sunshine. I lost TC for this day, but it was 306a.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Then that one moment. Tetre made another ACless hit on #25 Prince – who’d trained to suicidal (337/278) OP, but apparently forgot AC all-in. He had intimated – 8hrs before his hit – that he had a hit lined up in 9h. Lightning decided that he would intentionally bounce on someone to give 29 a free shot at Tetre. It was the subject of loads of discussion and the point that 29 might snatch the win now was raised multiple times. In the end, it went through. We didn’t all agree on the decision, but we at least understood it. Erik summed it up best:
</p><p><br />
</p><p>"Giving them free 100% hit is just plain stupid but kills a cheatzor"
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Day 43:
</p><p>10:58:15 AM Victorious on the battlefield, Napoleon Bonaparte (# 16) conquered 337 land from The Prince (# 25).
</p><p>5:20:42 PM Sadly, the forces of Russian roulette (# 16) were beaten back by Forest Mirage (# 28).
</p><p>5:40:59 PM Battle Rain (# 29) invaded Napoleon Bonaparte (# 16) and captured 504 land.
</p><p>6:08:19 PM Velveeta Village (# 29) invaded Napoleon Bonaparte (# 16) and captured 467 land.
</p><p>Day 44:
</p><p>1:19:09 AM Sadly, the forces of WoodOfSteal (# 16) were beaten back by Velveeta Village (# 29).
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Following this, the round heated up more as 29 became more and more powerful, allowing them to outtrain Lightning completely. Lightning held off on razing Velveeta too, which would’ve been possible after Daniel bounced because he forgot war wasn’t active any more. If done, this would’ve done about 2.5 – 3&#160;% damage to all of his OP/DP, based on what we observed on the raze on #28. Lightning then found one last hit late day 45 on the ridiculously underdefended #19 Halfer:
</p><p><br />
</p><p>11:59:48 PM Victorious on the battlefield, Russian roulette (# 16) conquered 399 land from genuit sacra lumina (# 19).
</p><p><br />
</p><p>I believe he could leave 25&#160;% of his OP at home.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Eventually, the round culminated in yet another war declaration by #29, which turned out to be for more OP and for Portals. We were set to go for a 3:2 scenario – it seemed the most likely with them banking to tank Lightning’s economy completely, when #14 took City of Gold. We hadn’t anticipated people warring for City on day 48 of all days. This freed up Portals to go to 29 and ended with me deleting to not be a 29 snack and Lightning releasing his OP. The rest is, therefore, second-hand information.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>Apparently, Tetre messaged Lightning and said he may still save the round by suiciding if he got a public apology. Lightning wasn’t inclined to do that, so it didn’t happen. Battle Rain did leave himself open to a 5:4 suicide from #27 Troll – the same one he hit after Lightning released all his OP - and then another from Tetre. This didn’t happen and so the round was over. #27 said that he did not think it would affect the outcome and Tetre said he slept through his window of opportunity.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>I don’t think it’d be a lie if I said that everyone in the pack is pretty gutted with how the last few days went down. Congratulations to #29, but you’ll forgive us if some of us aren’t too happy at the moment.
</p><p><br />
