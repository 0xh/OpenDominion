<p>Round 4, the round of high profile farmers, evil hobbits, a caged undead, betrayel, deceipt, account traders, war at the top and bottom feeders. Pretty much a round like any other
</p>
<ul><li> Realm 10 took a lead right from the start. They didn't have a lot of dominions but they consistently had 3 of them in the top 10 land. The fact that they had some good starters really helped them get of on the right foot.
</li></ul>
<p>DarkLich (Liesje #10): "I think a large part of it had to do with the wonder... if you compare the 6pack in 10 to the 6pack in 37, the talent level is basically equal. We were a bit faster at the start, but they had better finishers in general and the massive wonder.
</p>
<ul><li> There was a lot of commotion about realm 399 and their recruiting tactics. Steel had posted to the general board to say they had some password protected spaces left. These belonged to someone else in the realm that had not been able to fill them up. It also enabled them to get more of the "famed" Nadir in their realm. Nadir took with it a not too positive reputation from Utopia, which did nothing to endear people to realm 399 and many hoped they would fail miserably. When they started to use "Nadirian Style" retaliation tactics it only enforced people's opinion of them.
</li></ul>
<p>Steel (Soulless Nadirian #399): "Actually, I noticed an increase of outside hits when there was all this gossip about us on the forums, with posting our location, and calling us cheaters. Any newbie who wanted attention basically semi-suicided on us, and I thought it to be wise that I reacted with some severe countermeasures to keep them away. When the attacks settled down to a usual level (normal retals on us, and some randoms every now and then), I loosened our retal policy quite a bit."
</p>
<ul><li> Most land this round must have been swapped back and forth between realm #211 and realm #10. There were repeated hits on eachother right from the start.
</li></ul>
<p>Jack (Ballroomdancing Balrogs #211): "Well, early in the round I contacted #10 about a NAP, seeing how they dominated the top rankings... and they declined (not suprisingly, but I could try . After we stole the dragonlair they offered a NAP, but we did not take it because there was still a score to settle... and so we did not NAP for the rest of the round, which eventually meant that I was grabbed again by Kirsten, but also allowed me to make the largest non suicide grab of the round (1752 acres)"
</p><p>kancer (Kristen #10): "At one point I noticed that I could break him (Jack) if he sent out and that he would have to send out wraiths if he was to retaliate.... I went on irc and asked him for a NAP and him and Fox (Incubus on Viagra!! #211) said no, I then asked again and said I was having mercy, again they declined, so I logged in and took 850 acres off him, he then semi-suicided on me and took 1750. I was a little upset that my calcs were so far off, but noticed that he had sent out a hella alot of wraiths, so I calced it and hit him for 950 acres, then noticed that my 500 WR's coming in next hour would allow for another hit. So I waited 15 min and smacked him again, a double hit fair and square.... after that we basically went our own ways, I don't know if he was ever planning on getting me back, but he wasn't able to."
</p><p>Jack (Ballroomdancing Balrogs #211) on his alleged semi-suicide: "Well, that lot was about 10% of my wraiths, but yes, he could grab me back twice, but the two grabs together still were smaller then my one grab, and I kept a lot of barren acres for cases like this."
</p>
<ul><li> Not satisfied with just swapping land anymore at one stage realm #211 also decided it was time that the Dragonlair changed ownership. They proceeded to take the lair down with outside help.
</li></ul>
<p>Jack (Ballroomdancing Balrogs #211): "Well, the two realms that helped us got a NAP with us for it, so they knew that the Dragonlair would not be used against them, so in that way they still benefitted from it. We were obvious the smaller party, the outside help stayed relatively limited, and we were not the only victim of #10... so it was basicly an action of some victims of #10 who tried to undermine the powerbase of #10."
</p>
<ul><li> Christmas came and as always at holiday time some people can't log on too much or at all. Same thing happened with DarkLich (Liesje #10) and gZa (Marie #10). They decided to hand over their dominions to Macros and Stormweaver to take over so the realm wouldn't suffer from their leaving. The deletion of these dominions greatly contributed to weakening the powerbase that realm #10 once was.
</li></ul>
<p>DarkLich (Liesje #10): "Well, it didn't make a difference to me what happened to the account, I would have liked it to finish well but it wasn't really a concern. However, it being there was definitely a good thing for the realm. So I gave it to a very capable player. I half expected it to get deleted, way too many people knew I was leaving. On my end, I could care less whether Ross deleted it, the player deleted it, or I did myself."
</p><p>kancer (Kristen #10): "DL's Liesje went to Stormweaver, and gZa's Mary went to Macros....They took em just to cause an uproar with the boards at the end of the round, but they asked Ross if traded like that was wrong, and Rross said yes so they were gonna delete, but Ross deleted em first."
</p>
<ul><li> There had been some accusations that Fox (Incubus on Viagra!! #211) farmed during the round. Fox never denied the accusations and admitted to farming the suicider that hit him. It in turn sparked the usual zillions of threads on the board with it ending up with Master P (Lisa #10) farming himself of Mortis (Warriors on Rampage) who had released for him. He said it was to bring the subject of farming firmly to Ross's attention and to make him realize something needed to be done about it. One way or the other it did make Ross change the rules, so now it is not possible to totally suicide or release all your troops at the one go.
</li></ul>
<p>Fox (#Incubus on Viagra #211): "I was just chatting on IRC while checking the boards and my account, while suddenly I see in my news I got bounced. So I check his realm and see he was a bit smaller than me. So i spied on him and saw he had EVERYTHING out. So i told the guys on IRC about this suicide and then whacked him 4 times. I never denied I farmed a suicider. But truth is it would have been better for my dominion if the guy hadn't hit me at all."
</p>
<ul><li> klix (Reborn #29) decided that life at the top wasn't dangerous enough yet and attacked the one realm most people would not even dare look at. The "scary hobbits" in realm #270.
</li></ul>
<p>Celtillus (Stealth #270): "Reborn hit Cutthroat earlier in the round, but we pretty much let the hit slide. We established good relations with him actually, with things like stealing gems from the realm that was competing with him for the obelisk. This benefitted us both nicely; he got the obelisk and the gems we stole funded our temple quite nicely. Later he hit Pickpocket, followed by a hit on Thieves of Fortune 12 hours later. That's when the first, smaller set of demoralizations began. Before that relations had been fairly good. In fact Reborn had nailed X-file in #348, who our realm had good evidence to believe was both a plat and a land farmer. That caused her to go inactive for a while, and then he sent us to her as one of the best plat targets we had gotten in a while.I didnt steal any personally since I had been one of the earliest transitioners to attacker in my realm and had a poorer ratio than the others, but some of those in my realm that were still exploring got quite a kick out of the income boost "
</p>
<ul><li> In light of the seemingly good relations realm #270 was somewhat suprised at the actions of Reborn, but seeing as they did not have an official NAP it was not like he was breaking anything. After being demoralized for a while Reborn apologized to realm #270 and they entered a permanent state of NAP which was to last about a week.
</li></ul>
<p>Celtillus (Stealth #270): "A week later he came back much bigger and badder, and he hit backstabbers pretty hard, and I got a message saying he had gone through his entire RG range and found no other targets. The part that bothered my realm was the part where we were told that he knew we had a history of heavy retaliations, and that if we tried it he'd knock us all out of his RG range and make us "vamp food".vRiccio and I were the only people in his RG range, even with devoting all our stealth that was *not* enough to hold him since we did 3% in op, so reluctantly I told him we couldnt do much of anything, but that he betrayed our trust and that doing so always gets reciprocated someway and somehow.
</p>
<ul><li> Celtillus described Reborns account to "have been traded around like a Pokemon card" this round. It's possession was first with goobs who handed it over to klix. Allegations that MoDo was running the account with klix had been running abound for a long time. Either the allegations were wrong, or they were real good about hiding what they were doing as Ross did not delete Reborn's account. Kancer still had some unresolved issues regarding this as his realm mates did get deleted for apparently the same thing.
</li></ul>
<p>kancer (Kristen #10): "One day i calced that i had enough off to break Reborn, I was in IRC and they (klix and MoDo) were bragging about their hits, and Solace mentioned to me that they had said I was of no threat, so I got ahold of the best hobbit in the game *cough*celt*cough* (editors note: Celt was the one taking this interview of kancer) but wasn't able to get ahold of him, I tried contacting all of 270 cuz I had had words with them about taking klix down, I left messages with all of them, and took a big risk, i layed my big fat fist into klix's gut as i took 1350 acres )"
</p><p>Celtillus (Stealth #270): "I got a message from kancer a day after that. He said he could break Reborn, but gave me the impression that he could be broken back if he did. I talked to my realm, and we offered to demoralize Reborn so he CANT do anything in return. Kancer made a whopping hit, it knocked him into the range of about four of us. We took him to 0% morale, before the land from the hit that Reborn had made came in. At that point, I was the *only* one in his range. I was barely able to hold him down until two more of my realm-mates could get into his range; his morale was at 60% or so when they finally did and I thought I'd lose reborn again (in which case I'd have *really* gotten my ass kicked hard) we barely made it though. I put it to a vote and they voted pretty much unanimously to keep him down all round. I didnt like it, but I did what I had to do "
</p>
<ul><li> A friend of mine described Reborn as a "pitbull on a leash". Looking at his cs and the massive offensive power he had at his disposal to use if he had had any morale to attack with, I have to say that was a very accurate description.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> During a large part of the round realm #37 and realm #399 were vying for the top realm position eventually putting them neck to neck and culminating in a war between them for the ranking. Many like the war between them as it was not often that top realms actually went head to head to fight for the place. At the end of the round and the war realm #37 took the top ranking for land and networth.
</li></ul>
<p>Steel (Soulless Nadirian #399): "During the entire round I have had numerous requests from my Realmies to declare war and have some fun -we WERE the warring nadir, after all =) So in the end I basically felt like giving them what they wanted...We had had a lot of attacks from 37 on us lately, and when I was grabbed again by someone from 37 I felt like giving my realmies their way =)"
</p>
<ul><li> This is the basics of round 4. We tried to give you a wee recap with enough info so your own memories will be sparked enough to remember all the other details of the round. Final word goes to the round winner kancer (Kristen #10):
</li></ul>
<p>"I'd like to get that label of "slow-ass starter" erased, cuz I did damn good this round. It feels great... but now I'm a little depressed cuz I can't ever better myself, and I can't follow that up, anything I do next round is gonna be worse than this, I can't even pick a race to play... sheesh. Last of all, i'm proud that i took gobbo to 1st place, ross said that it was possible, and challenged us to do it, and i pulled it off"
