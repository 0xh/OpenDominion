<p>Hi,
</p><p>By the time this story is finished I may or may not have won the round. Even if I havent I would like to share my experiences with you. I have not kept track of all hits I made this round, but I will tell you about the most important ones. I probably forgot a lot, feel free to ask me about stuff.
</p><p>Everything starts with protection. I made a sim based on a couple of goals I had:
</p><p>full bone breaker OP
as high keep as possible
train all drafts
</p><p>keep might sound very strange to you, but I figured that factories are very
overrated during protection. I decided to not waste any plat on rezoning and build all leftover forests to lumberyards. investing (not national banking) all leftover lumber in keep. this got me to 4% keep OOP on about 540 acres.
</p><p>My OOP results:
</p><p>Savage 10
<br />Guard 1.296
<br />Voodoo Magi 10
<br />Bone Breaker 950
</p><p>Land 530
<br />Peasants 6.220
<br />Draftees 0
<br />Networth 31.447
<br />DP 6.695
<br />OP 7.426
<br />Plat/hr 27.611
</p><p>My OP/DP were like this:
</p><p>OOP: 7.8k /4.5k
<br />12 hours OOP: 7.5k/8k
<br />24 hours OOP: 7k/10k
</p><p>I seriously messed my OOP hits, bouncing twice and making one out of EG range hit (causing me to loose prestige due to heavy invasions). I gained 180 acres and similar prestige.
</p><p>I grabbed doggystyle 12 hours out, he was leading in the prestige ranks by then. Also I figured orcs would become my biggest problem. I was afraid he would train savages to retal me, but apparantly he got scared and went full def.
</p><p>I kept hitting every 12 hours, only possible due to the great help of two great realmies: negativa and putamadre. Many thx for that guys!
</p><p>My early strat was something like this:
20% smiths, 7% LY, 15% DM, 4% docks, 3% OM, 5.5% towers, 10.8% farms, rest
homes.
</p><p>I know rax would give more speed, but since I already was fast on the keep I went full homes. Savages are crazy cheap and I only trained em in case I needed just that extra few points. Bone breakers are quite cheap also.
</p><p>I had big farms as you can see, because I thought I would be swarmed 24/7. This was luckily not the case since then I would have needed more like 12% farms. In fact I got swarmed only twice this round. I still cant believe it.
</p><p>Since that hit on doggystyle I kept on hitting attackers in my lower 75% range. Using mickles great site: www.domhq.net I made a targetdatabase there that let me see if any dominion dropped in NW, which usually means they sent out. The round was kinda routine first weeks. Hitting building, having just enough OP to hit my range rest in def. This way our realm wouldn't attract any peaces. Peaces are killers for orc, since there is no prestige gain then.
</p><p>I had nothing to fear from anybody this round, except a time period of 3 hours. That was when I was too late seeing #55 lyc massing GN (it still is a mystery why he did that, coz he could already hit 90% of top 100 without those). This was the only moment this round that I could have been hit without a raze first. I expected he would hit me, as I was their only threat at that moment: I had more peasants, superior improvements, more efficient military and a realm to support. Instead he surprised friend and enemy by hitting #71 lyc, who had max shrines, almost no imps and full ratmen defense (read: a dying dominion, that could easily be used as landprovision later on).
</p><p>The moment he made that hit, he started the construction of my runaway. Since I was aware of his OP I trained enough defense. Big BF was pissed and suicided him, providing me with acres. With those acres my economy got superior to that of #55 and I continued hitting low 75%. #55 attracted peaces from all my potential targets and my prestige gains thrived.
</p><p>Then something happened which almost made me delete. I bounced on #33 lyc while I was to hit his nomad realmie. I just selected the wrong guy. I got heavily frustrated over this. Told my packies I would. Some of you might know the feeling.
</p><p>Anyways, #55 started to notice they were loosing hold on the round and instead of getting their economies right they kept on training enormous amounts of OP. Attracting even more peaces. As a response I kept training defense. Especially after kind word and a gun made his first raze attack on me.
</p><p>Then the moment that made my runaway a fact was when some lizz in #39 hit my realmie with having like 20% less dp then #55 had OP. I made that grab and got huge acres. #45 orc thought he was safe then and sent out also, but I had enough drafts to turn into savs and also grabbed him. I think it was a few hours after that I noticed biancoceleste had a 5k NW drop. I thought he sent, but this wasn't the case. Meaning only 1 thing: they were about to suiraze suigrab me (thx for the signals boys&nbsp;;)). There was exactly 1 hour that they could grab me with a raze. I made sure to be online at that moment as I stocked draftees and gems. I already had big SPA compared to any other attacker in range, to prevent sinkings. Then I blocked TONZ of draftee assassinations and knew the time would come. I think their entire realm did like 100 ops on me. You should see the list. Anyways, then gun made the raze and I invested 50k+ gems in walls (increasing walls with about .6%). As everyone in their realm wasted all strength on killing draftees they couldn't or didn't bother to check my castle again. And so came another bounce for em.
</p><p>Celtillus (jabberwock) had been going very nicely and had enough OP to retal Gun. I was about to retal biancoceleste, but then again I selected the wrong guy and hit gun. This totally frustrated me as msl (mortuary) was to double him. I wanted to quit again. Luckily msl still hit him after our realm killed tonz of his drafts.
</p><p>There ended my bouncy times: totalling 4 bounces this round. However, the razing times didn't end. After hitting dark wings allin and #11 lycsome other lyc decided to sui me also (cant remember who it was probz #11 or
</p>
<ol><li>35). Totalling 4 razes this round. The razes and bounces hurt me a lot, but since my economy was very good I still had huge advantage over the rest of dom. Together with celt and msl we killed the lycs.
</li></ol>
<p>We had troubles with #45 at some time. The kobbo in there was growing very fast and we figured he needed to be stopped. Also mriffy (#45 troll king) had techs prestige and an efficient dom. He would be a big problem lateround. Those facts together made us declare war on em to sink em and LB.
</p><p>Also I hit theexpert allin, halfway on his conversion. He was biggest converter at that moment and I figured it would be cool to grab him. Since I didn’t get the chance (invasion disabled) to do that when I was gnome. Shortly after that hit he decided that him and his fellow BGs (in multiple realms) needed to blackop spooks(nomad) and tomba(troll). Spooks and tomba did a great deal hitting wonders this round, as did a lot of other realmies. Death is inevitable, valentine party, venom, thx guys! In total we had Temple of the damned twice, obelisk of power, great wall and twice spire of illusion: totalling 500 prestige!
</p><p>I more or less hit most people out range, except 2 exploring lycs, a gobbo, switch (#55 nox) and traex (#33 troll). I was about to hit #33 lyc when the moment I wanted to invade him he suddenly disappeared. He deleted to prevent me from getting his acres.At the same point some icer entered my range, it didn’t change anything for me that the lyc deleted although some people on the boards thought different. With the #33 lyc gone, #43 lyc seemed to have no idea about top OP at all. Few days later when my realmies got the Temple of the Damned I hammered him. Same goes for the gobbo.
</p><p>After that I only had the switch and traex in range. Traex I couldn’t break and switch I did not have enough def to 4/3. Later on he just had enough allin def as I was also training to traex’ 4/3 suipower.
</p><p>Luckily I got 2 more lucky hits, coz pakdee (#33 nox) and PP (#45 DE) blindlessly entered my range. Apparantly PP had been smoking pot when he tought to have enough def allin to cover the 650k NW difference between us. Thx for the acres though.
</p><p>End of round I just decided to leave guard to make 2 BF hits to get to 10k. I left 20k+ bonebreakers at home on both hits. To give you an idea I had max OP on 850k vs nonGT targets + 6% temples. And max dp was 660k peace def allout.
</p><p>I was astonished most by all those people that sent out when I got out their range. Totally forgetting our dear sami&nbsp;:). Real nice job sami, I think this was about your most inactive round so far&nbsp;:’)

</p><p>My (very long) round story follows below:
</p><p>I originally wanted to take this round off, but my pack convinced me to play. I went lizardfolk because I didn't expect to be nearly as active as last round, and wanted a less time-intensive race and the ability to help my realmies with ops.
</p><p>I came OOP on 720 acres with 1150 chams and 700 serpents, with 10% GT incoming a few hours later from the facts I razed. I attacked once OOP with chams hoping nobody would notice, but #26 did and I'm fairly certain the dwarf there could have hit me, though it seems they decided on somebody else. I attacked again 12 hours out, though this time I had some lizardmen, so less chams needed to be sent. By 24 hours OOP I was fully converted and attacking with lizmen only. I attacked every 12 hours until I was 1300 by the end of the first week, which was top5.
</p><p>At that point #55 lycs added big temples, which didn't bode so well for me since I still had a fair amount of GT, so I had to stop for a while and pump a lot of raw defense. It was just as well since I had been running borderline dp the first week anyway, and made it a point now to secure myself. I only had 3.5k serpents when I switched to pure chameleons, so I was decently efficient by lizard standards (the rest of my serpents were all added in the last week). Once I felt I had trained enough I began attacking again and caught back up to the top.
</p><p>I was running big dp and just enough op to hit 75% this whole time, so I wasn't remotely scary yet. Even with my training lots of defense the #55 lycs continued to be problematic, particularly when they added GN in addition to their temples. Fortunately there were two occasions where they both attacked the same hour at the start of the hour, allowing me to hit and be back the same time as them.
</p><p>It was at this point that we warred #69 for the obelisk. I wasn't able to leave guard until 12 hours after the war dec came into effect, so I used the bonus to make an attack on one of them first, before dropping guard to attack obelisk. When I hit it, Woopidee Doo in #69 messaged me to tell me my op was pathetic. Apparently he failed to notice that I was increasing my lizmen by 50% in the span of 12 hours. When my troops got back from destroying the wonder, I hit him. I guess the lesson here is that if you're going to make fun of somebody's op, make sure they can't easily break you in 12 hours. Anyway he was icer, so the land went to GN. In addition to the obelisk and all the lizmen I had pumped, I had big op for the first time this round.
</p><p>Shortly afterwards #55 attempted to take down harmonius, with Gun razing and Biancoceleste suiciding (but bouncing). Gun left pretty strong dp and had ratmen incoming hourly, so I don't know if he was trying to defend himself and didn't notice my GN, or he just didn't care. Either way I was able to hit him.
</p><p>It was great to finally have the #55 threats out of the way. From there I pumped for a couple more days then kept going. I attacked a gobbo explorer in #53, Ignorance is Bliss (dwarf in #26), and Kiss Goodbye (lyc in #11, a suicider) in pretty rapid succession.
</p><p>By this point harmonius was too big to be stopped. I wasn't by any means. Yet what surprised me was that nobody really tried to take me down once they realized it was futile to fight harm any longer. Instead people skipped right past me and went straight to bashing emesel and spooks, often giving me land in the process.
</p><p>First Istar (Goblin in #77) attacked spooks without bothering to do a single op on me, and I retaliated easily. Then Cavern of Doom (Lyc in #35) attacked spooks sending a lot of WW (he could have hit me sending only 2k more, I don't know why he didn't). I wanted badly to hit #35 back since he had hit my realm 3 or 4 times already, but I couldn't hit him out of range, and I was convinced he would sui me unless I did. It was here that emesel volunteered to double him after me. Emesel insisted on doing so knowing that his dp would probably not be sufficient, yet another selfless act by him. So him and I killed #35 and that was pretty much the end of all the big lycs this round.
</p><p>Throughout this time my realm was having our extended war with #45. It had started to sink their kobbo, who was becoming a threat, but ended in devastation for many in both our realms. Fortunately I was big enough to be out of range of most of their guys. We did however lose the obelisk. We took the wall from them and promptly lost that also.
</p><p>Later Rio (Firewalker in #26) attacked emesel. Rio had done a pretty decent job of checking me, so I don't know what he missed when he attacked my realm, probably a few hours of my BS which could have included substantial amounts of troops. So I was able to hit him. I should probably mention that he had quite an impressive dominion at this point, and by quite a margin he was top op after my realm.
</p><p>When I got home from this very few people were in my range, so I had no chance to attack again. But then Seljuk Turks (Nox in #33) accidentally took his DB to enter my range, while he was out, so I attacked him also.
</p><p>I got home from this and #45 kobbo was now the only attacker in my range, having gotten his boats back and growing very quickly. He was out making his 3rd hit in a row and had big enough dp that I couldn't break him while he was out, nor could harmonius hit him all-in when he got his land. I mentioned to spooks that he was becoming problematic again, so spooks suggested I suicide him. After spooks was nice enough to BS a ton of attackers to make sure none were entering my range in the next 12 hours, and determining that I would take enough land from the kobbo (with war bonus) so he wouldn't re-enter my range with his incomings, I did indeed suicide him. It was a full 4:3 send of about 8k chameleons. My dp was so low that had people been in range to hit me I would probably have been scripted.
</p><p>Shortly afterwards, the #33 exploring lyc deleted to avoid being hit by harmonius. This left nobody in my range except the #43 exploring lyc, who had no spies. So I stocked plat for days and then dumped a colossal amount of lizardmen. I had done many such op pumps this round, but none close to the scale of this one. It was nice since I only had to login 2x a day to cast spells. Here is the barracks spy from hell:
</p><p>Lizardmen: 17688 438 316 314 300 - - - - - - 944 26257 (20000)
</p><p>From that point things ground down to a crawl, and it became on a matter of sitting at the top and waiting for people to come into range, with several days between hits. We got the temple of the damned sometime in here also.
</p><p>Doggystyle (orc in #75) was the first to enter range, and got hit all-in. Later I was able to hit the exploring lyc in #43.
</p><p>We lost the temple here. Happy New Year (icekin in #11) came into my range then, but I was still able to hit him without it. Then my realmies retook the temple for us, but it was promptly attacked again by two realms. Pulp (merf in #26) came into my range just as it was going down, so I scrambled to try and hit him before it was destroyed. I had to release 1,500 wizards to 4:3 him all-in.
</p><p>Then followed an extremely prolonged and boring buildup with nobody entering my range except trolls with huge turtlepower, and switch (nox in #55) who wouldn't send. I sat for almost a week, during which we gained and lost the spire of illusion twice. Finally a DE explorer from #73 came into range halfway through day 49, whom I hit for 560 or so.
</p><p>That was it for my attacks. I dropped guard at the start of day 50 to explore 84 acres and finish an even 9,000, releasing even more wizards for the draftees to do this. I considered making one final attack out of guard but decided it would be a pointless risk, finishing 9k or 9.5k would have been the same thing to me.
</p><p>I ended the largest and strongest lizardfolk in dominion history by quite a margin, so I'm very happy with it. I never expected to end anywhere close this size with such a relatively inactive round, but I had a lot of realm help and a lot of luck. Thanks to my realmies for getting me so many wonders and for getting ops on everybody sitting below my range who might jump into it. Also congrats to Traex and Switch on excellent rounds, the only two doms who were consistently in range of harmonius and me and still avoided ever being hit.
</p><p>And an even bigger congrats to anybody who actually read this far&nbsp;:P
